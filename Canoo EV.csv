Identify the industry in which Canoo EV operates,https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/,"Continuing our spotlight on electric vehicle companies you may not have heard about yet is Canoo ($GOEV). The California-based EV startup in beautiful south bay is beginning to ramp up production of multiple electric vehicles. With two EVs unveiled and more on the horizon, Canoo is an electric vehicle company to keep an eye on. Canoo was originally founded in 2017 by two former employees of rival EV automaker, Faraday Future. Ulrich Kranz and Stefan Krause originally called the new startup Evelozcity. Within two years, however, the founders decided to pivot to something a bit more simple. According to Stefan Krause, We picked Canoo because it sounds distinctive, looks cool and creates a feeling of both relaxation and movement. For thousands of years, a canoe has been a simple, sustainable transportation device used all over the world. Later that year, Canoo unveiled its first electric vehicle, an electric passenger van by the same name. The Canoo looks like something out of Westworld.  It immediately set the tone for the brand’s futuristic vision toward its vehicles. Canoo focuses on minimalist design and utilizing space wherever possible, rather than compartmentalizing different parts of the vehicle. In early 2020, the Canoo electric van caught the eye of Hyundai Motor Group. It quickly announced plans to jointly develop an electric vehicle platform for future Hyundai and Kia vehicles. Furthermore, the proprietary skateboard platform will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle components stacked atop it. This is due in part to its “drive by wire” steering, meaning there is no traditional steering column, just connectors. It will allow companies to move the steering wheel wherever desired to better fit the body sitting upon it. Canoo’s funding momentum continued to snowball throughout 2020. By fall, it announced a pending merger with Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV. The merger was completed two months later, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. Canoo is now listed on the NASDAQ as $GOEV. With the support of South Korean automakers and Wall Street, Canoo has spent the last year building toward the delivery of its first EV, The Canoo.  Canoo’s passenger van utilizes maximum cabin space while still sitting atop its modular EV platform. This gives it the footprint of a compact electric vehicle, with the interior of an SUV. The exterior features 22 windows, offering enhanced light and visibility for passengers and drivers. According to its website, the Canoo will only be available in black. Nevertheless, Canoo says endless vehicle wraps will allow owners to customize their EV however they’d like. Moving inward, the Canoo’s interior is designed to feel more like furniture than car seats. With room for seven, the backseat feels like an ultra-modern breakfast nook or a glass limousine.  Up front is minimalist indeed. The information panels exist between the windshields and the glass roof, but are concealed by fabric. Data such as range and speed is illuminated through the fabric when the car is operating. What is most unique about the Canoo van is that it has zero screens. Where current EV automakers are adding larger touchscreens, plus screens for drivers and passengers, Canoo has gone the opposite direction. Instead, the EV offers seamless connectivity to your smartphone using the Canoo app. There is a dock in the center of the dash to hold it in place as well (not visible below). According to the full specs on Canoo’s website, this van will operate with rear-wheel drive on a single, magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor will offer 300 horsepower and 2,803 ft-lbs of peak torque. Its 80 kWh battery pack offers 250 miles of range and can charge to 80% capacity in 28 minutes using DC fast charging. The Canoo will be able to reach a top speed of 125 mph and travel 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds. Consisting of 90% steel, the electric van weighs about 4,450 lbs.  Lastly, these specs are for the RWD single motor, but the Canoo website briefly mentions an AWD powertrain. However, Canoo has not yet offered any further specs. Apart from its overall look, the Canoo is also unique in that it is a subscription-based EV. The Canoo membership will offer a month-to-month and commitment-free alternative to owning or leasing a car. Canoo members will receive 24/7 access to their personal Canoo, as well as additional services like charging, maintenance, and insurance. All these features would be included for a single monthly payment. Canoo has not yet revealed what this subscription model may run you each month. That being said, if the price is right, it could be worth testing out. Currently, the Canoo electric van is scheduled to launch sometime in the second quarter of 2022. For now, prospective customers can join a waitlist to get first dibs when they do deliver.  The most recent electric vehicle unveiled by Canoo is its MPDV, an all-purpose, modular delivery van. The MPDV sits on the same Canoo platform, but with a much different body catered toward deliveries and business owners.  According to Executive Chairman Tony Aquila during the MPDV unveiling, Canoo wanted the EV to appear very smart, but affordable. Its purpose is to serve as a power plant for business owners to pull up, plug-in,  and immediately “do their thing.”  The MPDV was built from the inside out with the users of the EV in mind throughout the development process. As restauranteur Roy Choi phrases it in the video, “it’s like an RV, a van, a delivery truck. Everything all-in-one.” That’s a solid summation from what Canoo has revealed about the MPDV thus far. You can watch the entire unveiling from last December right here: The overall design of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle is both form and function for the working class. Its plug-and-go features offer fully customizable plug-ins to fit your needs. That means no more noisy generators. Customers can have 120- or 240-volt outlets on either side of the exterior, or realistically anywhere else they’d like.  The MPDV’s flat panels throughout the exterior offer owners their own billboard on wheels. They can wrap or design these panels however they’d like, to advertise their business or catch the eye of passersby.  Currently, Canoo has listed two size variations for the MPDV with a third in development. The MPDV1 is 14.4ft x 6.4ft x 6.2ft and offers 230 cubic feet of cargo space, including the front cabin. Depending on the battery capacity, it can haul a payload between 1,540 to 1,980 pounds. The MPDV2 is larger at 17.1ft x 7.2ft x 8.4ft, although it sits on the same platform. This version offers 500 cubic feet of total cargo and can haul between 1,320 and 1,760 pounds. Moving inward, there is a clear focus on sleekness, functionality, and durability. The front cabin does not contain a lot of gadgets. Three phone-like screens offer various pieces of data pertinent to drivers.  According to Tony Aquila, the Canoo lineup was strategically built as a technology platform to not only aid customization, but future innovation. The software within the MPDV is geo located. This can help business owners like food trucks, for instance, keep their customer base informed of its location in real-time. That means no more having to look up hours on social media and hoping the truck is actually there. Additionally, the Canoo platform is operating under level 2.5 autonomy, assisting drivers in safely avoiding danger on roads. Aquila states that as autonomous technologies continue to advance, Canoo will be able to easily incorporate them on its technology platform using over-the-air software updates. Moving toward the rear, the clear focus is function. The unveiling video points out that a grown man can stand in the back without having to duck or crouch. Additionally, the rear is better lit with natural light from the all-glass front. This offers anyone in the back more visibility and that vital vitamin-D. What is most unique and exciting about the MPDVs in particular is the modular capabilities. With the working class in mind, Canoo designed this multi-purpose vehicle to be customized by each and every customer. Whether it’s a live-in camper, a food truck, or an apparel mart on wheels, the top half of MPDV can be reconfigured and designed to offer owners everything they need. We’ve already touched on the variations in size and cargo space between the two MPDVs currently announced by Canoo. Next, let’s dig into the performance and range.  The MPDVs offer front-wheel drive from one permanent magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor offers 200 horsepower and comes with three battery options: 40, 60, or 80 kWh. Starting with the MPDV1, the EPA estimated ranges are as follows: 130 miles on the 40 kWh battery, 190 mi on 60 kWh, and 230 mi on 80 kWh. The MPDV2 can travel 90 miles on a 40 kWh battery, 140 mi on 60 kWh, and 190 mi on the 80 kWh.  Lastly, let’s talk pricing. While the Canoo van will be a monthly subscription, the MPDV will be available for purchase due to its fully custom abilities. The MPDV1 starts at just $33,000 and goes upwards based on custom modifications. It is currently available for pre-order with a $100, refundable deposit. The automaker has previously said a limited rollout of the MPDVs will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch slated for 2023. While Canoo has yet to release its first electric vehicle, the prospect of its unique approach to the market remains exciting. It will be interesting to see how Canoo’s van subscription model will work and if it will find success. If it does, we will keep an eye on the EV market and see if any competitors adopt a similar strategy. The automaker will begin rolling out its first EVs in the US next year. It also plans to expand to the rest of North American and eventually Europe. In addition to its electric van and two versions of the MPDV, Canoo has an even larger MPDV3 being developed.  Lastly, at the end of the MPDV unveiling video, Tony Aquila and Roy Choi ride off, and behind them sit two more prototype EVs covered in black sheets. While it’s impossible to tell exactly what they are, one is shaped like a sedan and the other, a pickup truck. Their black silhouettes are also featured on the Canoo website as “coming soon.” While they are still prototypes, it’s encouraging to see the American automaker with two more potential EV offerings in its pipeline. That’s it for Canoo for now. Keep an eye out for future updates on the company from Electrek.

Identify the industry in which Canoo EV operates,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoo,"  Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4]  Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7]  In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]    In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11]  In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]  In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]  In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]  In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]  A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]  In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]  In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]  In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]    On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]  It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]  On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]  On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]  On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]  In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.  Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]  On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]  In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]  Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]  In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59] "
Identify the industry in which Canoo EV operates,https://evsroad.com/features/canoo-electric-vehicles/,"Canoo is an EV startup based in the US. The company came to light when it struck deals with Walmart, Zeeba, and NASA. Canoo is looking to become the next big thing in the delivery industry of the US by providing cost-effective and sustainable solutions to delivery problems. Let’s see the lineup of Canoo electric vehicles, its history, and where it was founded. Without further ado, let’s begin! Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz founded Canoo Inc., commonly known as Canoo electric vehicles, in 2017. They developed the startup in Torrance, California, as a manufacturer of innovative and futuristic electric vehicles. Canoo has plans to launch electric trucks, multi-purpose delivery vans, tactical vehicles, and minibusses. The company does have a direct-to-consumer vision, but right now, its main focus lies in selling its vehicles to fleet customers such as NASA, Walmart, and Zeeba. Canoo has a very elaborate research and development team based in Auburn Hills, Livonia. This team consists of leaders and innovators from prestigious automotive companies. In short, the history of Canoo electric vehicles isn’t that old. In fact, it won’t be wrong to say that it hasn’t even begun yet. We cannot determine the actual reliability and effectiveness offered by the automaker until its vehicles are made available to the general audience. However, judging by first looks and test drives, Canoo will be a force to reckon with. Canoo was born in the wave of EV startups that had taken the US by storm. The advantage of being an EV startup is that you’re not bound by any previous legacy. There is a chance that you can be a real innovator. That has certainly been the case with Canoo. The company has decided its course much different from all its competitors. Canoo is looking to entirely disrupt the transportation industry. The top competitors of Canoo electric vehicles are Ford, Chevrolet, and Ram. These companies have the largest share of the transportation industry in the US. Their models, such as Chevrolet Express, Ford Transit, Ram Pro Master, and GMC Savana, are extremely popular with delivery companies. However, given that electric is the way to go forward, Ford and Mercedes are going to launch their electric delivery vans soon. Ford E-Transit and Mercedes eSprinter would soon arrive on the market to give tough competition to Canoo MPDV. But one thing is apparent Canoo has the first-mover advantage in this segment, and they have efficiently designed EVs to back their claim. Nonetheless, the actual on-road performance and safety of Canoo vehicles is yet to be tested. Currently, there are four vehicles in the electric car lineup of Canoo. In fact, all these vehicles are in the preorder stage. These vehicles are only made available for test drives. So, we know very little about the capability of these vehicles. Let’s analyze and review everything we know so far about Canoo electric cars. We’ll see their range, battery capacity, and charging infrastructure, among other things. Canoo lifestyle vehicle has become the talk of the town ever since it was revealed. It doesn’t remotely resemble any car or truck available on the market right now. It is a combination of unconventional design ideology and cutting-edge features that exceed industrial expectations.  Canoo has confirmed that for the first year, Canoo lifestyle vehicles will only be sold to fleet customers. Some confirmed orders of the lifestyle vehicle are by Walmart, Zeeba, and NASA. Canoo lifestyle vehicles will be offered in at least four different trim levels. The Delivery, Base, Premium, and Adventure trims will fulfill a specific purpose each. The delivery trim will have room for a single or two persons. The base trim will get five seats, whereas the premium and adventure trims will be seven-seaters. At a DC fast charging station, the Canoo lifestyle vehicle’s 80 kWh battery pack can achieve a charge from 10% to 80% in less than 28 minutes. The powertrain design of the Canoo lifestyle vehicle is very unique. It comes with a rear-mounted 200-pound motor that is capable of churning out 350 hp at 304 lb-ft torque. Now the unique part is that the output of the motor can be programmed between 200 and 350 hp. The lower horsepower setting will enable users to avoid wear and tear and help increase the lifespan of the motor. At the same time, a higher horsepower setting will deliver more power and an exciting drive. But the test drives suggest that Canoo lifestyle vehicles miss the factor of swift acceleration. However, I wouldn’t mind that. Canoo lifestyle vehicle is intended for a very different purpose. Plus, it is offered at an extremely affordable price of $39,950. At this price, it guarantees more than 200 miles of driving range and a cargo volume of over 121 cubic feet. Canoo Pickup Truck is going to be an exciting proposition. It will be a mix of revolutionary EV-startup-like design and practicality. On the one hand, it offers extraordinary features, while on the other hand, it has a strong powertrain and competitive driving range. The front end of the Canoo pickup truck very much resembles the lifestyle vehicle. Canoo pickup truck has the same uplifted look with signature T-style LED headlights and DRLs of Canoo. Canoo Pickup Truck will be offered in two different drivetrain options. A base single-motor rear-wheel drive variant will come with a rear-mounted motor that can generate up to 300 hp at 332 lb-ft of torque. The upper all-wheel drive variant will come with dual motors. The combined output of these motors will be over 600 hp at 550 lb-ft. This puts Canoo Pickup Truck right in the league of A-listers like the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV SUT. These trucks might take the lead on Canoo when it comes to the driving range and conventional design. Canoo pickup truck is laced with a standard lithium-ion battery pack of 80 kWh. The upper variant can go up to 200 miles between charges, whereas the base variant might go a bit longer. However, when it comes to unique features like safe-step, pull-out beds, and dual flip-down tables, Canoo has surely got out attention and an edge over conventional automakers. In case you’re wondering, a safe step is a pull-out platform/storage unit to keep tools and access the bed and roof rack in one single step. The pull-out bed feature extends the regular 4 ft x 6 ft rear bed to 4 ft x 8 ft to enjoy the benefits. In short, the Canoo pickup truck has a lot to offer. If you’re looking for the right mix of power, practicality, and high-end features, Canoo is the way to go. Canoo designed the multi-purpose delivery van with the purpose of offering maximum productivity, efficiency, and cargo volume. It provides substantial cost savings over conventional delivery vehicles. This is quite helpful for small businesses. Canoo MPDV is laced with a permanent magnet motor producing 200 hp at 236 lb-ft of torque. It will also come with a 2.5 autonomous driving capability which is equal to Tesla autopilot. Canoo MPDV is offered in two different versions. The smaller one will be called MPDV1, and the bigger one will be named MPDV2. The company plans to extend the line of MPDVs with a third one. Canoo MPDV1 and MPDV2 will be offered with three different battery pack options. The 40, 60, and 80 kWh. On each of these battery packs, MPDV1 can go up to 130, 190, and 230 miles, whereas MPDV2 can go 90, 140, and 190 miles on 40, 60, and 80 kWh batteries, respectively. Canoo MPDV will also support DC fast charging. It will regain its driving range up to 80% in less than 28 minutes at a rapid charger. So far, no safety tests have been conducted on Canoo vehicles. But since everything in Canoo vehicles is according to industrial standards, we expect these vehicles to be perfectly safe for driving. Canoo Truck will be custom-fitted for the US Army. However, there are no confirmed reports for that yet. The company has unveiled the camouflage-colored Pickup Truck with carbon-Kevlar reinforced body panels, which means that Canoo tactical vehicle will be bullet-proof against light-arm bullets. The cabin can accommodate up to two soldiers, and the military retro-fitted it for use. Canoo light tactical vehicle (LTV) offers multiple benefits, such as stealth and bidirectional charging. It has amazing stealth power due to its electric drivetrain. Canoo LTV is extremely quiet and emits little to no heat signature. There is very little competition in the space of light tactical vehicles. So, there is a bright chance that a deal will take place between the US Army and Canoo. Canoo electric vehicles bring a breath of fresh air to a transportation industry motivated towards a cost-effective and efficient solution. If Canoo is able to deliver on the promises made to its customers, it may emerge as the sole leader in the US delivery industry. What are your thoughts on the Canoo electric vehicles?

The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]  In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]  In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]  In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]  A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]  In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]  In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]  In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]    On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]  It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]  On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]  On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]  On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]  In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.  Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]  On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]  In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]  Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]  In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59] "

Identify the industry size of Canoo Ev,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Identify the industry size of Canoo Ev,https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/,"Continuing our spotlight on electric vehicle companies you may not have heard about yet is Canoo ($GOEV). The California-based EV startup in beautiful south bay is beginning to ramp up production of multiple electric vehicles. With two EVs unveiled and more on the horizon, Canoo is an electric vehicle company to keep an eye on. Canoo was originally founded in 2017 by two former employees of rival EV automaker, Faraday Future. Ulrich Kranz and Stefan Krause originally called the new startup Evelozcity. Within two years, however, the founders decided to pivot to something a bit more simple. According to Stefan Krause, We picked Canoo because it sounds distinctive, looks cool and creates a feeling of both relaxation and movement. For thousands of years, a canoe has been a simple, sustainable transportation device used all over the world. Later that year, Canoo unveiled its first electric vehicle, an electric passenger van by the same name. The Canoo looks like something out of Westworld.  It immediately set the tone for the brand’s futuristic vision toward its vehicles. Canoo focuses on minimalist design and utilizing space wherever possible, rather than compartmentalizing different parts of the vehicle. In early 2020, the Canoo electric van caught the eye of Hyundai Motor Group. It quickly announced plans to jointly develop an electric vehicle platform for future Hyundai and Kia vehicles. Furthermore, the proprietary skateboard platform will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle components stacked atop it. This is due in part to its “drive by wire” steering, meaning there is no traditional steering column, just connectors. It will allow companies to move the steering wheel wherever desired to better fit the body sitting upon it. Canoo’s funding momentum continued to snowball throughout 2020. By fall, it announced a pending merger with Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV. The merger was completed two months later, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. Canoo is now listed on the NASDAQ as $GOEV. With the support of South Korean automakers and Wall Street, Canoo has spent the last year building toward the delivery of its first EV, The Canoo.  Canoo’s passenger van utilizes maximum cabin space while still sitting atop its modular EV platform. This gives it the footprint of a compact electric vehicle, with the interior of an SUV. The exterior features 22 windows, offering enhanced light and visibility for passengers and drivers. According to its website, the Canoo will only be available in black. Nevertheless, Canoo says endless vehicle wraps will allow owners to customize their EV however they’d like. Moving inward, the Canoo’s interior is designed to feel more like furniture than car seats. With room for seven, the backseat feels like an ultra-modern breakfast nook or a glass limousine.  Up front is minimalist indeed. The information panels exist between the windshields and the glass roof, but are concealed by fabric. Data such as range and speed is illuminated through the fabric when the car is operating. What is most unique about the Canoo van is that it has zero screens. Where current EV automakers are adding larger touchscreens, plus screens for drivers and passengers, Canoo has gone the opposite direction. Instead, the EV offers seamless connectivity to your smartphone using the Canoo app. There is a dock in the center of the dash to hold it in place as well (not visible below). According to the full specs on Canoo’s website, this van will operate with rear-wheel drive on a single, magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor will offer 300 horsepower and 2,803 ft-lbs of peak torque. Its 80 kWh battery pack offers 250 miles of range and can charge to 80% capacity in 28 minutes using DC fast charging. The Canoo will be able to reach a top speed of 125 mph and travel 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds. Consisting of 90% steel, the electric van weighs about 4,450 lbs.  Lastly, these specs are for the RWD single motor, but the Canoo website briefly mentions an AWD powertrain. However, Canoo has not yet offered any further specs. Apart from its overall look, the Canoo is also unique in that it is a subscription-based EV. The Canoo membership will offer a month-to-month and commitment-free alternative to owning or leasing a car. Canoo members will receive 24/7 access to their personal Canoo, as well as additional services like charging, maintenance, and insurance. All these features would be included for a single monthly payment. Canoo has not yet revealed what this subscription model may run you each month. That being said, if the price is right, it could be worth testing out. Currently, the Canoo electric van is scheduled to launch sometime in the second quarter of 2022. For now, prospective customers can join a waitlist to get first dibs when they do deliver.  The most recent electric vehicle unveiled by Canoo is its MPDV, an all-purpose, modular delivery van. The MPDV sits on the same Canoo platform, but with a much different body catered toward deliveries and business owners.  According to Executive Chairman Tony Aquila during the MPDV unveiling, Canoo wanted the EV to appear very smart, but affordable. Its purpose is to serve as a power plant for business owners to pull up, plug-in,  and immediately “do their thing.”  The MPDV was built from the inside out with the users of the EV in mind throughout the development process. As restauranteur Roy Choi phrases it in the video, “it’s like an RV, a van, a delivery truck. Everything all-in-one.” That’s a solid summation from what Canoo has revealed about the MPDV thus far. You can watch the entire unveiling from last December right here: The overall design of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle is both form and function for the working class. Its plug-and-go features offer fully customizable plug-ins to fit your needs. That means no more noisy generators. Customers can have 120- or 240-volt outlets on either side of the exterior, or realistically anywhere else they’d like.  The MPDV’s flat panels throughout the exterior offer owners their own billboard on wheels. They can wrap or design these panels however they’d like, to advertise their business or catch the eye of passersby.  Currently, Canoo has listed two size variations for the MPDV with a third in development. The MPDV1 is 14.4ft x 6.4ft x 6.2ft and offers 230 cubic feet of cargo space, including the front cabin. Depending on the battery capacity, it can haul a payload between 1,540 to 1,980 pounds. The MPDV2 is larger at 17.1ft x 7.2ft x 8.4ft, although it sits on the same platform. This version offers 500 cubic feet of total cargo and can haul between 1,320 and 1,760 pounds. Moving inward, there is a clear focus on sleekness, functionality, and durability. The front cabin does not contain a lot of gadgets. Three phone-like screens offer various pieces of data pertinent to drivers.  According to Tony Aquila, the Canoo lineup was strategically built as a technology platform to not only aid customization, but future innovation. The software within the MPDV is geo located. This can help business owners like food trucks, for instance, keep their customer base informed of its location in real-time. That means no more having to look up hours on social media and hoping the truck is actually there. Additionally, the Canoo platform is operating under level 2.5 autonomy, assisting drivers in safely avoiding danger on roads. Aquila states that as autonomous technologies continue to advance, Canoo will be able to easily incorporate them on its technology platform using over-the-air software updates. Moving toward the rear, the clear focus is function. The unveiling video points out that a grown man can stand in the back without having to duck or crouch. Additionally, the rear is better lit with natural light from the all-glass front. This offers anyone in the back more visibility and that vital vitamin-D. What is most unique and exciting about the MPDVs in particular is the modular capabilities. With the working class in mind, Canoo designed this multi-purpose vehicle to be customized by each and every customer. Whether it’s a live-in camper, a food truck, or an apparel mart on wheels, the top half of MPDV can be reconfigured and designed to offer owners everything they need. We’ve already touched on the variations in size and cargo space between the two MPDVs currently announced by Canoo. Next, let’s dig into the performance and range.  The MPDVs offer front-wheel drive from one permanent magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor offers 200 horsepower and comes with three battery options: 40, 60, or 80 kWh. Starting with the MPDV1, the EPA estimated ranges are as follows: 130 miles on the 40 kWh battery, 190 mi on 60 kWh, and 230 mi on 80 kWh. The MPDV2 can travel 90 miles on a 40 kWh battery, 140 mi on 60 kWh, and 190 mi on the 80 kWh.  Lastly, let’s talk pricing. While the Canoo van will be a monthly subscription, the MPDV will be available for purchase due to its fully custom abilities. The MPDV1 starts at just $33,000 and goes upwards based on custom modifications. It is currently available for pre-order with a $100, refundable deposit. The automaker has previously said a limited rollout of the MPDVs will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch slated for 2023. While Canoo has yet to release its first electric vehicle, the prospect of its unique approach to the market remains exciting. It will be interesting to see how Canoo’s van subscription model will work and if it will find success. If it does, we will keep an eye on the EV market and see if any competitors adopt a similar strategy. The automaker will begin rolling out its first EVs in the US next year. It also plans to expand to the rest of North American and eventually Europe. In addition to its electric van and two versions of the MPDV, Canoo has an even larger MPDV3 being developed.  Lastly, at the end of the MPDV unveiling video, Tony Aquila and Roy Choi ride off, and behind them sit two more prototype EVs covered in black sheets. While it’s impossible to tell exactly what they are, one is shaped like a sedan and the other, a pickup truck. Their black silhouettes are also featured on the Canoo website as “coming soon.” While they are still prototypes, it’s encouraging to see the American automaker with two more potential EV offerings in its pipeline. That’s it for Canoo for now. Keep an eye out for future updates on the company from Electrek.

Identify the industry size of Canoo Ev,https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2024-canoo-lifestyle-vehicle-first-drive-review/,"Well, if there's one thing our favorite electric vehicle startups have all shared, it's a penchant for innovation—from luxury hatchbacks with third-row seats and SUVs with ""falcon-wing"" doors, to trucks with gear tunnels and supercar suspensions, to 500-mile sedans powered by 500-plus-hp motors tiny and light enough to fit in a roll-aboard suitcase. Now we're adding to that roster the 2024 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle—a 21-window retrotastic van with mosh-pit seating, swappable ""top-hat"" bodies, and a truly fresh take on vehicle life-cycle planning. It's a question worth asking about any EV startup that hasn't yet produced cars yet, and things indeed looked a little shaky last year for the California-based firm. But like Rivian, Canoo is lining up fleet customers to keep the lights on (e.g., Walmart has ordered 4,500 LDVs, or Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles). Unlike Rivian, Canoo will only be selling to fleet customers for the first year of production. (Those customers will also hopefully soon include the U.S. military, for Canoo's Light Tactical Vehicle that we also reviewed.) These fleets will expose the vehicle to harder use than retail families would, and so will swiftly and efficiently uncover any remaining development issues prior to the retail launch of the passenger-carrying Lifestyle Vehicle. More Canoo: The VW Microbus-esque Lifestyle Vehicle was the first Canoo to break cover, and a simpler delivery-van version of that body is the first to launch. The first 120 ""Gamma"" prototypes of various models have been built in Livonia, Michigan, at Roush Industries (we drove one of these not quite final-final models). Roush has provided worker training and assembly services, but the tooling and manufacturing process all belong to Canoo, and the employees overseeing them have either been flown in from Oklahoma or hired locally by Canoo with plans to relocate to Oklahoma when official production migrates there in the first quarter of 2023. The first official customer vehicles began rolling off this temporary line on November 17, bound for Walmart, NASA, and other fleet buyers. Pickup variants (in regular, extended, and crew cab configurations) are still part of the product plan, and we're assured features like the drop-down sides, gear-tunnel drawers, extending pickup floor, and ""barn-door"" tailgate are still part of the plan. The larger, more angular Multi-Purpose Delivery Van (MPDV) program is also still active. And current production plans call for initially producing more skateboards than top hats, suggesting the company sees a market for this low-profile, fully by-wire platform. Simply climbing aboard is a unique experience. The front doors are wide and rectangular, meaning there's open space right where your head usually ducks under an A-pillar. The rear doors are also wide and swing open on rear-mounted hinges—like on a Rolls-Royce or Lincoln Continental Coach Door. And as in those cars, the main bench seat is positioned behind the C-pillar, leaving floorspace sufficient for practicing yoga (or mounting a wheelchair ramp). Premium models get jump seats that mount to the doors, with retractable seat bottoms and full three-point belts. When deployed, their occupants face each other, and unoccupied cushions can serve as ottomans for the outboard bench-seat occupants. Two more jump seats fold down behind each front seatback, but they're only for use when stopped, with the front seatbacks leaned forward. The rear-door windows don't go down, but the rear quarter windows do, and there will be an option to have the little vista windows around the roof perimeter pop open. When folded up against the front seatbacks, wings on the temporary jump seats serve as outboard armrests for the front occupants—which they need, because moving the front seats far enough inboard for the driver's feet to clear the front wheels puts the doors out of reach. The pedal environment is perfect, but while there's a single center armrest between the seats, there's no room for a center console, and two burly linebackers might rub shoulders. There's no ""dashboard."" A digital speedometer readout and indicators for the turn signal and drive gear are centered at the base of the windshield. Below this is another window offering a view of what's immediately in front. That panel may one day open to access stowage space ahead of the front occupants' feet. Multiple thin pillars separating the various glass panels ahead of the official A-pillar didn't prove distracting and overall visibility is excellent. A 10.0-inch touchscreen mounts to the driver's A-pillar, within easy reach of the steering wheel. It controls most secondary functions (rails above and below are planned, for steadying a hand on bumpy roads). That screen seems designed to minimize distraction, offering few compelling infographics … yet. Wiper controls share the turn-signal stalk, while the right stalk serves as the gear selector. Climate controls are arrayed across a slim aluminum cross-car beam, within reach of the passenger. The HVAC system is convective, relying on circulating air, not air that directly blows on the occupants. As such there are no vent registers visible except a row along the top of the windshield. In 40-degree weather, the 72-degree setting quickly felt comfortable with no dry eyes, but the tougher test will be how quickly such a system can make occupants feel cool on a hot day—especially in a vehicle with so much glass. Canoo's seating arrangement prioritizes excellent comfort for four or five, passable comfort for seven (in those premium models), and not much cargo flexibility—of the 130 cubic feet of space available in the LDV, there's only room for 13.0 cubes of stuff (or three golf bags) behind the folding-backrest, non-removable rear seat. It's NOT a minivan, remember? Riding on the wheelbase of a Toyota Prius with by-wire steering controlled by a square steering ""wheel"" twirling a lightning-quick rack (1.2 turns lock-to-lock), it feels nimble and quick-witted, and the turning circle is crazy tight. The skateboard chassis features patented composite transverse leaf springs of variable cross-section, which helps keep the entire suspension low—the tops of the shocks are about even with the tops of the tires. The LV swallows speed bumps with suppleness, while minimal body lean, squat, and dive suggest a certain sportiness. This isn't a ""forward-control"" van like a Microbus, but the upright, forward seating position places the driver's eyes unusually close to the steering axle. Combine this with that speedy steering and we managed to clip the first curb or two. Braking regen is programmable in three levels ranging from unobtrusively light to full one-pedal driving. The rear-mounted 200-pound motor, which Canoo designed, builds, and holds 58 patents on, is capable of 350 hp and 304 lb-ft. Canoo envisions making output programmable between 200 and 350 hp, with lower power boosting efficiency, reducing wear and tear, and potentially lowering use-based insurance costs. It was set to 285 hp for our drive, and in a 4,750-pound vehicle with three people onboard, its weight-to-power was worse than that of a Chevy Bolt EV or Nissan Leaf.  Canoo's 9.7:1 gear reduction ratio is notably shorter than those two, though, so it accelerates more snappily, but it's certainly no rail gun. A future two-motor AWD version with both motors cranked to max output may wear the muscle-van moniker more comfortably. Canoo originally proposed an all-subscription model, but inflation and volatile interest rates complicate such a model. Retail sales and leasing will primarily be handled online and directly with the factory. Canoo contends that the value of a vehicle is ultimately determined by its second and third owners. Toward that end, the company's skateboard design prioritizes longevity and quick, easy repairability with lifelong upgradability. A powertrain swap takes two hours, and the entire body top hat shouldn't take much longer. In this way, the Canoo recalls a different vintage VW—the Beetle—many of which enjoyed second lives as sand rails and dune buggies. We've loved the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle's exterior design from the moment we saw it (especially the pickup). We're intrigued with the interior layout and we look forward to spending more time in it to answer questions like, is supreme footstool comfort for two rear occupants some of the time worth making occupants six and seven miserable sitting sideways? Is loading bulky stuff in through the back doors as easy/easier than loading it in the hatch? Is there enough luggage room for reasonable trips with four or more occupants?"
Identify the Identify the industry growth rate of Canoo EV,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day.

Identify the Identify the industry growth rate of Canoo EV,https://electrek.co/2022/12/22/canoo-goev-now-has-a-million-dollar-reason-to-produce-evs/,"EV startup Canoo (GOEV) has been battling all year to bring its “breakthrough” electric “lifestyle vehicles” to market. The company now has up to a $1 million incentive to manufacture new EVs at its Oklahoma City plant, but there’s a caveat. Founded in 2017, Canoo has raced into the EV market with big expectations. Although, like many EV startups, Canoo quickly began burning cash without a full-scale production vehicle.  After posting a $125 million loss in the first quarter of 2022, Canoo expressed “significant doubt” it would be able to continue operations. However, since then, the EV startup has signed several supply agreements, including an order for up to 10,000 “lifestyle delivery vehicles” from retail giant Walmart. Demand for Canoo’s electric vehicles continued building throughout the year, reporting over $2 billion in orders, with $750 million binding in the third quarter.  Until now, Canoo has been contract-manufacturing its EVs with production capabilities capped at around 10,000 units. In its next phase, Canoo plans to manufacture in-house, with the ability to scale production as needed.  Canoo announced in November it was ready to begin EV production after selecting a 630,000-square-foot move-in-ready plant in Oklahoma City. This week, the city council approved a partnership with Canoo that can earn the EV startup up to $1 million in incentives.  After announcing Oklahoma City as its future EV manufacturing home, Canoo said its new facility would employ more than 500 people and be equipped to achieve a 20,000 unit run rate annually by the end of next year. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt posted on Twitter, saying if Canoo delivers on its job creation promise, the EV startup “can receive up to $ 1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development.” Canoo is planning to manufacture new vehicles in OKC, creating as many as 550 high-paying manufacturing jobs in our city.  If these jobs are created, Canoo will receive up to $1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development. pic.twitter.com/AlNKFz3nsD Mayor Holt adds that although Canoo is planning to produce EVs in Oklahoma City by next year, if it doesn’t come to fruition, nothing will happen, and the fund will remain untouched.  However, if Canoo does pull through like all of us are hoping, the company will receive its incentive, and Oklahoma City will gain “hundreds of high-paying manufacturing jobs in a growing sector of the modern economy.” Despite another over $100 million loss in the third quarter, Canoo says it can raise capital if needed. In addition, Canoo believes its “Made in America” focus has positioned it favorably to earn incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, touting itself as one of the only companies that can take advantage of them immediately.

Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://www.motortrend.com/features/canoo-electric-car-6-thoughts-ev-startup/,"We first reported on the intriguing Canoo electric-car startup last month—what follows are six thoughts from Kim Reynolds, one of the most knowledgeable EV experts in automotive journalism today.  ""So, could you tell me about the name, Canoo?"" Three weeks ago, I typed the address of a new EV startup called Canoo into Google Maps. Canoo? That strange name was the first thing I was going to ask about when I got there. Pulling up to a surprisingly large, two-story building in Torrance, it took a while to find an empty spot. But inside, I was quickly greeted by Canoo's CEO, Ulrich Kranz, a slight, wiry man in his sixties who speaks with a precise, German accent. After a quick tour downstairs, I followed him up a narrow staircase, and at the top, swerved left into a meeting room. I glanced to my right as we did—and was startled by the scene: a giant room of people seated at several long curvy tables, all, staring at monitors and stirring mice. Pulling up a chair across from Kranz, I asked ""Ah, how many people are working here?"" (That question about their name would now be number two) ""About 300"" Three hundred people have been working on a futuristic electric car 5.5 miles from our office—and I didn't know about it? Actually, I'd already heard of Canoo through a friend and knew something was up but pictured a two-guys-in-a-warehouse scenario. Not this sophisticated beehive of an automotive skunkworks. ""So, could you tell me about the name Canoo?"" ""We considered many names, but Canoo has a connotation of moving effortlessly, like flowing down a stream in a boat."" If you're a traditional high-performance enthusiast, you're holding up a clove of garlic right now. But if you're intrigued by what's new and creative on wheels, here's a whopper of an example. When Ulrich Kranz describes his electric car as having a skateboard platform, he really means it. Walking me around its exposed skeleton, he pointed out the rear, 300-hp motor, its rear-wheel steering, fully electric front steering (not just power assisted), its very short, compact suspension, and holding it all together, the slab-like 80 kW-hr battery pack composed of 2,170-type cells (like the Model 3) for an estimated 250-mile range. None of it is higher than your knee. It's so obsessively integrated, in fact, that the chassis doubles as the battery casing, and the whole skateboard so unified it could drive by itself. It's a return to the automobile's early days when a premium car company would build a drivable chassis and then ship it to a coachbuilder who would artfully fashion a magnificent body on top. A hundred years later, Canoo's initial body is a sleek space-pod that winks with cues from 1960s VW minivans (including pop-open, skylight windows—yay!) Climb in and its aft interior is a wrap-around vista-view greenhouse lounge that includes a pegboard for notes. Up front, it's a NASA fever dream, with an ankle-height lower windshield, and a dashboard that's condensed into a simple cabin-spanning bar that succinctly displays essential digital information. It's a thumb-in-eye to the Byton's panoramic screen; instead, just attach your familiar IOS or Android phone or tablet. The Canoo leaves the choice of secondary displays to you. If they aren't reinventing the display, they certainly are, the wheel. Or steering wheel, which seems to be floating in space, attached only to the cross-bar-dash and doesn't have a column—it's 100 percent electric. OK, calm-down, Infiniti is already selling its Direct Adaptive Steering (electric, with a traditional steering column back-up engaged by a clutch); the Canoo's safety net is a redundant electrical circuit. We're going to see more of this as autonomy approaches, but for now, the Canoo has seven cameras, five radars and 12 ultrasonic sensors for Level 2+ driver assistance. And after watching Tesla's turmoil trying to manufacture the Model 3, the Canoo will be manufactured by an experienced, Michigan-based contract manufacturer who's been working with Kranz' team every step of the way to avoid snafus. ""When you subscribe, you think differently about a car — now the value is defined by the user benefit. ""  You've probably read about how we're now living in the non-owned, shared-stuff, subscription economy. It's already all around us in the car world, from Uber and Lyft ride-hailing to micro-renting like Zipcar and Turo. But attempts to introduce car-subscription alongside car-buying and car-leasing (by far the number one method) haven't found much traction. Nevertheless, that's the business model that Kranz is staking Canoo on. His pitch is simple: you pay an initiation fee and then an all-encompassing monthly subscription, which may include ""registration, maintenance, insurance management, and charging—all from a single app."" And you can cancel it at any time. Kranz points to Fair (whose website describes its used-car subscriptions as longer than a rental but without being locked into multi-year lease) as the right way to go. But Kranz has an original twist: unlike Fair, Canoo's vehicles are not only new, customers will always own them. So they'll never be exposed to the market, meaning the market can't ascribe a huge initial depreciation. By decoupling from the market, Canoo can calculate your subscription cost based on their actual costs over a longer, 10-year-plus service life. I.e., it'll be cheaper. Like the Canoo's looks? Don't? Then either cheer or hiss 38-year old lead designer Richard Kim. Walking around it, I smiled as it took me back to a think-tank discussion I had at Art Center in Pasadena a couple years ago with design students and their transportation instructors as we tried to image what the rumored 'Apple Car' might look like. ""It'll be a sleek minivan with both its ends looking alike"" somebody said ""as if it could go in either direction."" Here's the Canoo with that very bi-directional ambiguity. Richard Kim has been going in many directions himself lately—and his collage of EV projects paint a portrait of the most fertile and influential vision in modern individual mobility. During his years at BMW, he was responsible for the i8 Spyder concept and the i3 (with its much-copied, EV circuit-board sideview). Then the still-gorgeous Faraday Future FF91 (its fin-shaped C-pillar now echoes from the second-gen Nissan Leaf to the Volvo XC40) and its Chinese corporate cousin, LeEco's LeSee. And today, this abstract and minimalist Conoo. While Franz Von Holzhausen's handsomely aging Tesla Model S remains the gold standard of EV sculpture, even he admitted his aim was simply to create a great-looking car, not an EV re-imagination. It's Richard Kim's busy pencil-hand that's been busily sketching those. He's the guy you've never heard of who's designing your future It's getting noticeable. Everywhere you turn, there's a musical chairs of ex-BMW ""i"" engineers leading EV start-ups. And when you ask how they got here, they all say the same thing: when BMW pressed the pause button on ""Project I,"" they'd already become so hooked on moving fast and designing for the future, they couldn't go back. Dr. Carsten Breitfeld was responsible for the i8 program before joining Daniel Kirchert (ex-Infiniti and BMW Brilliance) to found China's Byton. Then, after a stint at another Chinese EV startup, Iconiq Motors, Breitfeld today has the Sisyphean job of saving California's ever-foundering Faraday Future. And now, here's Kranz—also ex-BMW i—who became Faraday's CTO, then acrimoniously left along with CFO Stefan Krause (ex-BMW i) to found Canoo, which is designed by Richard Kim (ex-BMW i). One of the big jobs of new BMW CEO Oliver Zipse is reversing this EV exodus. A few days after my Torrance visit, I had an unlikely encounter with Elon Musk, and out of curiosity, asked him what he thought of the Canoo. ""Canoe?"" he asked. ""You mean … a boat?"", he scrunched his eyebrows and looked confused. ""The EV start-up"" I answered. He stared, eyebrows scrunching more. It still rang no bell in the Musk mind. I guess juggling cars, rocket ships, boring giant holes, and wiring cyborg brains is enough to think about. But six miles away from our conversation, Kranz's 300-person team—many of them, ex-Tesla employees—were at that moment beavering away to soon get his attention."
Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://electrek.co/2024/01/19/canoo-gets-real-as-deliveries-of-its-electric-commercial-van-begin/,"Walmart-backed EV startup Canoo has announced that deliveries of its all-electric commercial van have officially begun – and the first production Canoo LDV 130 vans are already hard at work. The first batch of Canoo’s electric vans are reportedly in service now at Kingbee, a national work-ready van rental provider. The company says the delivery of vans to Kingbee is consistent with its previously announced “phased ramp-up manufacturing approach,” and asserts that additional customer deliveries will continue throughout 2024. Canoo had previously delivered vehicles to NASA, the US military, and the State of Oklahoma (its home state) for testing. The vans delivered to Kingbee, however, seem to be the first that will be accessible to “the public.” “We are proud that an increasing number of our vehicles are on the roads of America, and we are looking forward to our vehicles joining Kingbee and its impressive list of customers,” said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman, and CEO of Canoo. “Our vehicles are engineered for service workers, and optimized for safety, reliability, and comfort. This is what distinguishes our vehicles and provides a competitive edge for commercial fleet companies.” Kingbee placed a binding order for 9,300 Canoo electric vans back in November, with an option to increase that order to 18,600 vehicles at the same price. For its part, Kingbee will upfit, custom wrap, and deliver its Canoo LDV130s as work-ready fleet solutions for use across the United States. I have a small holding that I've practically written off. It seems like Canoo will need to raise more money to survive. However, this is a day to be celebrated for sure.   I hope they can get some more time - their product seems to be great. “We are excited for the opportunity to help fleets transition to electric vehicles,” says Scott Haslam, CEO of Kingbee Vans. “Fleets of all sizes use Kingbee as a flexible option for vehicle acquisition, and we’re honored to be among the first to add Canoo to our EV portfolio.” There are any number of knowledgeable, well-informed people in the EV space who have given up on Canoo – and that’s understandable. Like the now defunct efforts from Lordstown, Proterra, and others, Canoo’s management has cited large orders from well-known companies for years as a “reason to believe.” Canoo’s announcements always seemed to contain the word “binding,” however, and that makes all the difference. In case you’re curious, Canoo has secured … … and that’s just what I found before I got bored of looking. Whether or not those orders, combined with Walmart’s investment, will be enough to get Canoo from the starting blocks to mainstream adoption remains to be seen.

Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://electrek.co/2022/11/11/canoo-goev-begin-commercial-ev-production/,"It’s an exciting time for American EV startup Canoo (GOEV) as the company gears up to begin commercial production. After acquiring a new manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, the company says it’s working on starting production on its own equipment this month.  Canoo has overcome adversity all year. After barely skidding by in the first quarter, taking an over $125 million loss, and expressing significant doubt it will be able to continue, Canoo is on its way to begin commercial production of its flagship electric vehicle, the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV).  Since the first quarter, the EV startup has made substantial progress, signing an agreement with Walmart to supply up to 10,000 electric LDVs, allowing Canoo to live another day.  Although Canoo saw its losses widen in the second quarter, the company continued looking ahead, citing over $1 billion in pipeline sales while reiterating its intent to start commercial production in Q4.  According to Canoo’s latest quarterly earnings filing, the company is on track for the start of production (SOP) on November 17, 2022, after orders doubled to over $2 billion ($750 million binding). The EV startup had several highlights in Q3, including:  Canoo’s announcement to begin EV production comes after securing access to new funding and acquiring two manufacturing facilities to produce its Lifestyle Vehicles, with expected deliveries to begin in 2023. After considering multiple locations, Canoo chose the Oklahoma City location because it was “an existing commercial site with more than 630,000 square feet of move-in ready space and significant room for further expansion.”  The OKC facility will be adapted for Canoo’s needs featuring a full vehicle assembly line with state-of-the-art-robotics, a paint shop, and an unfitting center. Tony Aquila, Canoo’s CEO state: We are working with our third-party manufacturing partners to achieve SOP on our own equipment this month. Following these initial builds, we will aggressively shift all our equipment into our new facility during 1H’23 with production ramp in 2H’23. In addition, Canoo is expanding its production capabilities with a new EV battery module manufacturing facility. Once at full speed, the plant will have around 3200 MWh of battery module capacity. Despite another $117 million loss in Q3, Canoo says it has access to up to $200 million through an ATM offering program, which will allow the company to raise capital if needed.  The EV maker ended the quarter with just $6.8 million in cash, but as the company’s CEO states:  Our Made in America focus has positioned us favorably with the recently announced IRA bill, and we are proud to be one of the only companies, that can take advantage of these incentives immediately. Under the backdrop of a volatile market, we will continue to access the capital markets with our just-in-time, milestone-based approach. Canoo expects operating expenses between $70 million and $90 million in Q4 as the company begins commercial EV production on November 17, 2022. After running up to over $13 per share in November 2021, GOEV stock has come crashing back down to earth, down over 84% this year. Perhaps the start of EV production can charge up Canoo investors once again. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoo,"  Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4]  Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7]  In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]    In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11]  In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]  In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]  In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]  In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]  A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]  In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]  In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]  In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]    On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]  It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]  On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]  On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]  On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]  In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.  Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]  On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]  In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]  Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]  In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59] "
Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high. "
Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428915-canoo-changes-in-business-change-our-view,"Photo by 3alexd/E+ via Getty Images In a previous article we argued that electric-vehicle maker Canoo's (NASDAQ:GOEV) differentiated technology and go-to-market model would position it favorably in the EV space. The company came public last December following a SPAC merger. On March 29, they released their first financial quarterly report, and it is fair to say that investors weren't happy with the updates that management gave. The company announced a fundamental shift in its go-to-market strategy, away from contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and away from its subscription-model towards focusing on commercial EV opportunities. Shares of Canoo were hit hard after the report, and are down about 65% from the $20 highs we saw back in Jan/Feb, while the company's market cap shrunk to only $1.75bn as of this writing, one of the lowest from a basket of EV upstarts. Data by YCharts When Canoo announced in August 2020 to go public via SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition IV, management laid out an aggressive go-to-market strategy that built on two key pillars: one was the licensing and contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and secondly, the company also planned to sell its different EV-types (including a lifestyle and a multi-purpose delivery vehicle) directly to consumers via a monthly subscription (B2C). For their delivery vehicle the company aims at directly selling them to business in a B2B approach. The focus on these pillars was strongly presented in its SPAC presentation (see some excerpts below): Source: Company presentation The company also put significant focus on the commercial relevance of its contract manufacturing & engineering capabilities, on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology.  Source: Company presentation Both business segments would use the underlying multi-purpose skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture necessary for EVs. The beauty of the manufacturing approach on the basis of the skateboard is that the vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard, a so-called ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce cost and time to market. According to management the skateboard technology would be the first true steer-by-wire solution that would come to market, which would be an important differentiator from competitor offerings.  It needs to be mentioned here that also other EV manufacturers are working on similar technology concepts, including REE Automotive, which is going public through a SPAC with 10x Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC), and private-company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Canoo was planning to contract these manufacturing capabilities to other car manufacturers. Furthermore, management also pivoted towards selling its in-house developed cars via a potentially revolutionary approach, by offering a subscription plan that management claimed would be significantly different from a traditional lease and cost-efficient compared to an ownership model. And the company's plans should not stop here. Management also intended to sell its multi-purpose delivery vehicle in a B2B approach to capture share in the last-mile delivery market, while arguing that the delivery vehicle would offer best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options), and functionally-designed features, compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). The refreshing approach and multiple revenue streams that Canoo's management presented to investors, and the pivot away from the car industry's regular business model definitely drove some of the optimism and hype towards the company. While these were all nice promises, high hopes got crushed when the company announced its first results as a public company. When Canoo announced its first earnings report as a public company on March 29th, the first surprise for many investors was that the company announced key changes to its leadership team. It was announced that Chief financial officer Paul Balciunas would leave the company. Canoo also announced on April 22nd that Tony Aquila will also take on the role of Chief Executive Officer replacing former CEO Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April 30, 2021. While it is not clear as to why former CEO Ulrich Kranz resigned, it gives some bitter taste to the story and we definitely don't like the high leadership turnover. But these were not the only announcements that put pressure on Canoo's stock. The company announced a number of changes, including that it would no longer pursue the contract engineering part of its business. The reason was that the company wants to protect its intellectual property which it seemingly would not be able to do by licensing it to other manufacturers. On the conference call, analyst Craig Irwin asked about the conflicting statements that management gave:   Craig Irwin: Okay. The second question there - there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was - it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license. Tony Aquila: Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started - I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value. While the answer from Tony Aquila eluded to potential IP leakage and the concerns management had that this approach would not be driving the best shareholder value, we are not very happy with the contradictory explanation. This is especially concerning in light of the fact that Canoo initially planned to generate revenue from the contract manufacturing segment of >$500 million by 2025, with a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 (see our calculation here). It's dubious to us why management now suddenly makes a U-turn when the management team should not have provided such bloated numbers leading to its SPAC deal just to give potential investors false promises on what many investors saw as a key differentiator vs. competition. The announced change on the contract engineering front also undermines all hopes from Canoo's earlier announced partnership with Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) while it also puts to rest any hopes for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL). Again, management didn't give a clear answer to questions on their plans during the conference call when asked by analysts:   Joseph Spak: Okay. Well, last one for me, just going back to the decision to deemphasize engineering with the Hyundai arrangement the original one, which I'm assuming that that's now off the table. But if you go back to that release, did say Hyundai gains access to technology, you mentioned IP leakage is one of the potential problems with that arrangement. Can you just talk about, like how do you unwind that sort of memorandum of understanding what work was done? Do you think there was any IP leakage obviously Hyundai is coming out with their own electric vehicle platforms as well? Tony Aquila I think what happened is pretty kind of case in point. So I think the company, just like any adolescent companies, it's learning its way and all of us go through it. But it factored in contract manufacturing based on the labor of engineers, not based on the value of IP, which would have changed the value of that contract significantly. And look, we have experience in this area and we're very focused on if we do work, one, we can protect our IP and we can get the residual value of that in addition to. So it's kind of caused us to say, hey, let's put that on hold. We have so much demand for our three derivatives. Let's get all that work done. And then let's, look at if there is partnerships, partnerships can work in this industry. But contract manufacturing work is as you know is not the best business line to be in. The announced changes in Canoo's strategy don't stop here as management also mentioned that the previously announced subscription model for its direct-to-consumer offerings (lifestyle and sports vehicle) will now only be optional, and are expected to only account for a small part of its revenue going forward, especially since the consumer business will be de-emphasized in favor of commercial opportunities. This is a significant strategy shift as the company initially forecasted subscription revenue to reach almost $2 billion by 2026 (see forecast below). So again, why did management not get to the realization earlier that this would not be the most promising path?  Source: company presentation With all these changes, Canoo is now a fundamentally changed story and a perfect example of why investors should be cautious to believe in pre-SPAC projections. We have made a similar mistake by putting too much trust into management's projections. While we always took a very careful stance at the company's projections, the significant U-turn lead is to sell our shares over the past weeks. Wall Street seems to agree that the fundamental changes in Canoo's business model create many uncertainties to say the least: The recently announced changes imply a fundamental shift in the business and go-to-market strategy. While the core technology of Canoo's multi-purpose platform did not change, it remains a big question mark how the company will use this technology to generate revenue besides in-house manufacturing when they are shying away from building up a contract engineering business. Canoo remains only one very small player amongst many upstarts within the highly competitive EV industry. So deemphasizing potential revenue-generating partnerships will not only create a cash-problem going forward, but will also take off some of the buzz that was generated around the Hyundai, as well as the potential Apple partnership. The recent strategy changes create a high level of uncertainty as to how the company will finally be able to generate revenue. Canoo's business model is currently no more refined or differentiated than it was at its inception. In fact, it appears that management is not sure themselves what the best route to commercialization is. While several of the announced changes could be regarded as logical, i.e. the pivot towards commercial opportunities, the changes introduce further risk around the company's ability to execute. While it's probably worth asking as to how much the initial story really changed it is a fact that two main pillars of the company's initial forecast, i.e. contract engineering and car-subscriptions, which together accounted for a combined total of around $2.5bn in revenue until 2026, will simply be eliminated from the forecast. Since so much has changed and the path to revenue generation is increasingly unclear, we are distancing ourselves from Canoo stock for the foreseeable future. But Canoo's management may still prove their critics wrong with what's left of the company: an intriguing underlying technology and a market cap that is below the initial SPAC valuation and significantly smaller compared to many of its high-flying peers. However, this is simply too much of a gamble for us. So we will be staying on the sidelines on Canoo stock after selling all our shares over the past weeks.

Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://news.yahoo.com/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-100841631.html,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn't yet generated any revenue. Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews' new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: ""It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. ""Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)"" She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career. Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California's auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4482945-canoo-vs-workhorse-automobile-stock-better-buy,"  Petmal/iStock via Getty Images Growth investments, including most EV picks, have gotten pummeled over the last couple of weeks on the back of interest rate worries. With valuations having declined considerably, a closer look at some of the smaller EV players makes sense. In this article, we'll pit Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV) and Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) against each other to see which one is more attractive at current prices. The EV industry has seen a wide range of market entrants in recent years, which includes legacy players that started to introduce EV models, but which also includes many startups that are EV pureplays. Both Workhorse and Canoo belong to the group of EV pureplays. Workhorse is a company focused on medium-duty commercial vehicles that are battery-powered. Workhorse also offers services to its customers that are operating commercial vehicle fleets, such as telematics monitoring. During its third quarter, Workhorse generated the following results: Workhorse results Q3 Workhorse presentation Sales actually were negative during the quarter, although that was due to a one-time issue. Workhorse had to refund customers for faulty C-1000 vehicles. In previous quarters, WKHS didn't generate especially high revenue, either, however. During the second quarter, for example, Workhorse generated revenue of $1.2 million, which isn't nearly enough to cover the company's expenses. During the third quarter, Workhorse reported total expenses of around $25 million, before interest expenses and other losses, such as the loss on the sale of its LMC investment. Workhorse operates with a current cash burn rate of around $15 million per month, which is quite meaningful for a company with a market capitalization that does not have overly large financial resources. Workhorse is currently producing two units of its C-series truck per week, which makes for annual production numbers of around 100 vehicles. Clearly, at least for now, Workhorse is not in a position where production and sales are anywhere close to levels where they are economically viable in the long run. Workhorse is confident that it will manage to turn the company's operations around and that it will be a leading company in the transition of commercial vehicle fleets towards being electricity-powered. The market opportunity for Workhorse is great, of course. There are many millions of commercial vehicles on the road today, and that number will only grow going forward. Trends such as growing e-commerce sales, that require delivery vehicles, or growing consumption in high-growth countries such as India or China will result in more and more commercial vehicles being used around the globe. At the same time, due to companies being interested in lowering their emissions, and due to governments/authorities demanding lower emissions to combat global warming and air pollution, a growing number of these commercial vehicles will be powered by electricity. A lot of market potential alone doesn't make WKHS a great investment, however, as it is not guaranteed that WKHS will be among the future leaders in this high-growth and high-value market. Canoo is a diversified electric mobility company that is active in commercial and consumer markets. Like Workhorse, it seeks to become a major player in the emerging, high-value electric commercial vehicle market. Unlike Workhorse, Canoo is still in a pre-revenue stage, as it has not sold any vehicles yet. The company has a credible plan of bringing its first EVs to the market in the foreseeable future, however. Canoo is, unlike Workhorse, not entirely focused on commercial vehicles. Instead, the company plans to use its architecture for a range of vehicles in order to grow the total addressable market: Canoo outlook Canoo presentation Per management, the total addressable market is north of four million vehicles by now, although that alone does not make Canoo a buy, just like with WKHS. For now, the company seems to be on track to deliver vehicles in the foreseeable future, but commercial success is far from guaranteed. The answer to this question depends on how you define size. On a revenue and sales basis, Workhorse is the larger among these two, although even WKHS is pretty small in terms of the number of vehicles it has delivered so far and will be delivering this year. In terms of market capitalization, Canoo is the larger company by far: Canoo's market capitalization is around 3x as high as that of Workhorse, while Canoo's enterprise value is roughly 2x as high as that of Workhorse. GOEV has significantly larger cash reserves (on a net basis), at around $460 million, versus $70 million at WKHS. This explains why there is a larger difference between market capitalization and enterprise value at Canoo. At the same time, the larger cash reserves make Canoo the less risky pick, I believe, as Canoo has larger resources that can be used for ramping up production in the future -- although it is unlikely that the ~$0.5 billion of cash will be enough to bring the company to a size where it can self-fund all future growth. Workhorse, with its lower cash resources, is even less likely to get to a size where it can self-fund future growth before having to raise new money via debt or a secondary offering. Looking at manufacturers of electric commercial vehicles only, there are still a number of potent competitors worth noting. Rivian (RIVN), for example, has a deal with Amazon (AMZN) to order 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, making it pretty much a sure bet that Amazon alone will buy commercial vehicles worth billions of dollars from Rivian. This is a pretty strong endorsement for Rivian's product, and coupled with billions of dollars in cash that Rivian has on its balance sheet, it seems like a leading competitor for Canoo and Workhorse. Amazon has also ordered electric vehicles from other companies, however. This includes legacy players such as Stellantis (STLA) and Daimler (OTCPK:DMLRY), which naturally have vast resources, making them viable competitors in this space as well. On top of that, there are other EV pureplays with commercial vehicles on the market or in the works, such as Berkshire Hathaway-backed BYD (OTCPK:BYDDY). With in-house battery development and production, and significant experience in ramping up the production of EVs, BYD is, I believe, an important and capable competitor as well. EV king Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also seeks to become a player in the commercial vehicles industry with its Tesla Semi, although that is not a delivery vehicle primarily. In short, there is a wide range of competitors, many of those being highly capable, experienced manufacturers with large resources (personnel and financial). This has to be expected in a high-value market with lots of growth potential, though. Both companies are seeking to make a splash in the large and growing commercial vehicles market, but I do believe that their outlook differs. Neither company is profitable (in fact, quite far from it), but Canoo clearly is the company with better resources. Canoo's cash position, per its most recent 10-Q filing, is more than $400 million, and the company will benefit from financial incentives for building out its assets in Oklahoma and Arkansas. Workhorse, by comparison, has a little more than $230 million of cash on its balance sheet today, which will make it harder for the company to invest in its growth going forward. On top of that, doing a secondary offering is not a great choice for Workhorse, due to the company's low market capitalization. Even raising just another $200 million would dilute current shareholders by around 50%, whereas Canoo, with its higher market cap, could raise additional funds more easily. Canoo's platform that allows for a range of vehicles being developed at the same time, including consumer vehicles and commercial vehicles, has advantages: Canoo vehicles Canoo website With a larger addressable market, Canoo could be able to generate higher sales compared to Workhorse, which has a more narrow focus. On top of that, developing one platform and using it for more than one vehicle will allow for some cost synergies, as R&D expenses are distributed over several products, which could result in more attractive margins once operations are scaled up. Canoo is, thanks to its better financing and larger product portfolio, forecasted to generate significantly higher revenue compared to Workhorse: In fact, WKHS's revenue estimate has declined rapidly over the last half-year or so, as operational problems, such as the C-1000 recall, got factored into analyst models. Investing in a startup that is at a pre-revenue stage is always risky, but it seems like risks are higher at Workhorse compared to Canoo, even though Canoo isn't a low-risk pick, either. Due to a more attractive product portfolio, better liquidity, and better execution (no premature deliveries of faulty vehicles), Canoo looks like the better pick to me. I do not think that it is necessarily a buy, however. The commercial vehicles market will remain highly competitive, and it is far from guaranteed that a new market entrant will be successful, especially since competitors such as Rivian, Daimler, etc. have huge resources compared to Canoo. From a timing perspective, it also seems that investors might be better off not entering a position in either Canoo or Workhorse today. Both companies have seen their shares drop in recent weeks due to interest rate worries and a general bear market in ""speculative growth"" stocks. It is definitively possible that this selling pressure persists, which is why staying on the sidelines could be a wise idea until investors have a clearer picture of the production ramp and possible needs for additional capital raises. All in all, I'd thus say that Canoo is the better pick among these two companies, but that does not mean that buying Canoo today must be the best choice. Instead, keep an eye on Canoo, but wait for the current market turmoil to shake out and wait until we get a clearer picture about the production ramp could be an advisable strategy.

Published: 12:24 05 Jan 2024 EST    Canoo Inc (NASDAQ:GOEV), a California-based electric vehicle startup, is a “unique commercial and military EV play,” according to analysts at Wedbush initiating coverage of the company on Friday.  The company issued an Outperform rating and a price target of $4, nearly 20x the company’s midday trading price of $0.20. A big part of Canoo's appeal is its position in the last-mile delivery market, the firm noted. The company is partnered with Walmart and has an order book of more than $3 billion along with over $750 million in committed orders, which essentially sells its production until fiscal 2025.  “Canoo is poised for a golden opportunity on the last-mile delivery landscape while the electric battery market continues to heat up,” the analysts wrote. “Demand for lower mileage travel and greener delivery vehicles with average route length decreasing by 34% since 2000 continue to be a theme across the industry.” The company’s first vehicle is the LDV (Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle), which is expected to be produced in two sizes. One is known as the Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle, and the other is the Pickup Truck.  Looking ahead, Canoo is moving toward a production run rate of 20,000 units by the first quarter of 2024 at its Oklahoma City and Pryor, Oklahoma facilities.  “We believe the current climate is favorable for Canoo at this point as we are in the early innings of this $5 trillion market EV opportunity over the next decade with the auto industry is going through one of the biggest transformations not seen since the 1950s,” analysts wrote.  “Although in the infancy stages of its growth story, we believe it is important to keep an eye on this EV manufacturer chipping away at market share as this growth story unfolds.” Sign up to receive alerts and news direct to your inbox      Hive Digital Technologies CEO Aydin Kilic joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the company's earnings report for the third quarter.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors products or services offered,https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/,"Continuing our spotlight on electric vehicle companies you may not have heard about yet is Canoo ($GOEV). The California-based EV startup in beautiful south bay is beginning to ramp up production of multiple electric vehicles. With two EVs unveiled and more on the horizon, Canoo is an electric vehicle company to keep an eye on. Canoo was originally founded in 2017 by two former employees of rival EV automaker, Faraday Future. Ulrich Kranz and Stefan Krause originally called the new startup Evelozcity. Within two years, however, the founders decided to pivot to something a bit more simple. According to Stefan Krause, We picked Canoo because it sounds distinctive, looks cool and creates a feeling of both relaxation and movement. For thousands of years, a canoe has been a simple, sustainable transportation device used all over the world. Later that year, Canoo unveiled its first electric vehicle, an electric passenger van by the same name. The Canoo looks like something out of Westworld.  It immediately set the tone for the brand’s futuristic vision toward its vehicles. Canoo focuses on minimalist design and utilizing space wherever possible, rather than compartmentalizing different parts of the vehicle. In early 2020, the Canoo electric van caught the eye of Hyundai Motor Group. It quickly announced plans to jointly develop an electric vehicle platform for future Hyundai and Kia vehicles. Furthermore, the proprietary skateboard platform will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle components stacked atop it. This is due in part to its “drive by wire” steering, meaning there is no traditional steering column, just connectors. It will allow companies to move the steering wheel wherever desired to better fit the body sitting upon it. Canoo’s funding momentum continued to snowball throughout 2020. By fall, it announced a pending merger with Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV. The merger was completed two months later, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. Canoo is now listed on the NASDAQ as $GOEV. With the support of South Korean automakers and Wall Street, Canoo has spent the last year building toward the delivery of its first EV, The Canoo.  Canoo’s passenger van utilizes maximum cabin space while still sitting atop its modular EV platform. This gives it the footprint of a compact electric vehicle, with the interior of an SUV. The exterior features 22 windows, offering enhanced light and visibility for passengers and drivers. According to its website, the Canoo will only be available in black. Nevertheless, Canoo says endless vehicle wraps will allow owners to customize their EV however they’d like. Moving inward, the Canoo’s interior is designed to feel more like furniture than car seats. With room for seven, the backseat feels like an ultra-modern breakfast nook or a glass limousine.  Up front is minimalist indeed. The information panels exist between the windshields and the glass roof, but are concealed by fabric. Data such as range and speed is illuminated through the fabric when the car is operating. What is most unique about the Canoo van is that it has zero screens. Where current EV automakers are adding larger touchscreens, plus screens for drivers and passengers, Canoo has gone the opposite direction. Instead, the EV offers seamless connectivity to your smartphone using the Canoo app. There is a dock in the center of the dash to hold it in place as well (not visible below). According to the full specs on Canoo’s website, this van will operate with rear-wheel drive on a single, magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor will offer 300 horsepower and 2,803 ft-lbs of peak torque. Its 80 kWh battery pack offers 250 miles of range and can charge to 80% capacity in 28 minutes using DC fast charging. The Canoo will be able to reach a top speed of 125 mph and travel 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds. Consisting of 90% steel, the electric van weighs about 4,450 lbs.  Lastly, these specs are for the RWD single motor, but the Canoo website briefly mentions an AWD powertrain. However, Canoo has not yet offered any further specs. Apart from its overall look, the Canoo is also unique in that it is a subscription-based EV. The Canoo membership will offer a month-to-month and commitment-free alternative to owning or leasing a car. Canoo members will receive 24/7 access to their personal Canoo, as well as additional services like charging, maintenance, and insurance. All these features would be included for a single monthly payment. Canoo has not yet revealed what this subscription model may run you each month. That being said, if the price is right, it could be worth testing out. Currently, the Canoo electric van is scheduled to launch sometime in the second quarter of 2022. For now, prospective customers can join a waitlist to get first dibs when they do deliver.  The most recent electric vehicle unveiled by Canoo is its MPDV, an all-purpose, modular delivery van. The MPDV sits on the same Canoo platform, but with a much different body catered toward deliveries and business owners.  According to Executive Chairman Tony Aquila during the MPDV unveiling, Canoo wanted the EV to appear very smart, but affordable. Its purpose is to serve as a power plant for business owners to pull up, plug-in,  and immediately “do their thing.”  The MPDV was built from the inside out with the users of the EV in mind throughout the development process. As restauranteur Roy Choi phrases it in the video, “it’s like an RV, a van, a delivery truck. Everything all-in-one.” That’s a solid summation from what Canoo has revealed about the MPDV thus far. You can watch the entire unveiling from last December right here: The overall design of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle is both form and function for the working class. Its plug-and-go features offer fully customizable plug-ins to fit your needs. That means no more noisy generators. Customers can have 120- or 240-volt outlets on either side of the exterior, or realistically anywhere else they’d like.  The MPDV’s flat panels throughout the exterior offer owners their own billboard on wheels. They can wrap or design these panels however they’d like, to advertise their business or catch the eye of passersby.  Currently, Canoo has listed two size variations for the MPDV with a third in development. The MPDV1 is 14.4ft x 6.4ft x 6.2ft and offers 230 cubic feet of cargo space, including the front cabin. Depending on the battery capacity, it can haul a payload between 1,540 to 1,980 pounds. The MPDV2 is larger at 17.1ft x 7.2ft x 8.4ft, although it sits on the same platform. This version offers 500 cubic feet of total cargo and can haul between 1,320 and 1,760 pounds. Moving inward, there is a clear focus on sleekness, functionality, and durability. The front cabin does not contain a lot of gadgets. Three phone-like screens offer various pieces of data pertinent to drivers.  According to Tony Aquila, the Canoo lineup was strategically built as a technology platform to not only aid customization, but future innovation. The software within the MPDV is geo located. This can help business owners like food trucks, for instance, keep their customer base informed of its location in real-time. That means no more having to look up hours on social media and hoping the truck is actually there. Additionally, the Canoo platform is operating under level 2.5 autonomy, assisting drivers in safely avoiding danger on roads. Aquila states that as autonomous technologies continue to advance, Canoo will be able to easily incorporate them on its technology platform using over-the-air software updates. Moving toward the rear, the clear focus is function. The unveiling video points out that a grown man can stand in the back without having to duck or crouch. Additionally, the rear is better lit with natural light from the all-glass front. This offers anyone in the back more visibility and that vital vitamin-D. What is most unique and exciting about the MPDVs in particular is the modular capabilities. With the working class in mind, Canoo designed this multi-purpose vehicle to be customized by each and every customer. Whether it’s a live-in camper, a food truck, or an apparel mart on wheels, the top half of MPDV can be reconfigured and designed to offer owners everything they need. We’ve already touched on the variations in size and cargo space between the two MPDVs currently announced by Canoo. Next, let’s dig into the performance and range.  The MPDVs offer front-wheel drive from one permanent magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor offers 200 horsepower and comes with three battery options: 40, 60, or 80 kWh. Starting with the MPDV1, the EPA estimated ranges are as follows: 130 miles on the 40 kWh battery, 190 mi on 60 kWh, and 230 mi on 80 kWh. The MPDV2 can travel 90 miles on a 40 kWh battery, 140 mi on 60 kWh, and 190 mi on the 80 kWh.  Lastly, let’s talk pricing. While the Canoo van will be a monthly subscription, the MPDV will be available for purchase due to its fully custom abilities. The MPDV1 starts at just $33,000 and goes upwards based on custom modifications. It is currently available for pre-order with a $100, refundable deposit. The automaker has previously said a limited rollout of the MPDVs will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch slated for 2023. While Canoo has yet to release its first electric vehicle, the prospect of its unique approach to the market remains exciting. It will be interesting to see how Canoo’s van subscription model will work and if it will find success. If it does, we will keep an eye on the EV market and see if any competitors adopt a similar strategy. The automaker will begin rolling out its first EVs in the US next year. It also plans to expand to the rest of North American and eventually Europe. In addition to its electric van and two versions of the MPDV, Canoo has an even larger MPDV3 being developed.  Lastly, at the end of the MPDV unveiling video, Tony Aquila and Roy Choi ride off, and behind them sit two more prototype EVs covered in black sheets. While it’s impossible to tell exactly what they are, one is shaped like a sedan and the other, a pickup truck. Their black silhouettes are also featured on the Canoo website as “coming soon.” While they are still prototypes, it’s encouraging to see the American automaker with two more potential EV offerings in its pipeline. That’s it for Canoo for now. Keep an eye out for future updates on the company from Electrek.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors pricing strategy,https://blogs.idc.com/2023/09/01/electric-vehicle-market-dynamics-and-competitive-strategies/,"The automotive industry is facing the most important transition period in its history — the replacement of the traditional internal combustion engine with more sustainable, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly technologies. The traditional engine has dominated powertrains for more than a century.  In 2022, the worldwide Electric Vehicle (EV) market exceeded 10 million units, with a penetration rate of14%. In 2023, it is expected to reach 14 million units, with a penetration rate of 18%. Overall, China and Europe are leading the market, whereas the United States and other developing regions have great potential. Electrification, connectivity, autonomous driving, and ride sharing are the four key trends that drive this transition, resulting in the rapid growth of the global EV market. From supply side, governments take EV as a country strategy, providing subsidies to promote players developing their business.  More investments in R&D and innovation have resulted in breakthroughs in core technologies, such as 5G, OS,V2X etc. As such, traditional OEMs, technology giants, and emerging players are trying to seize the opportunities from the electric vehicle market. From the demand side, more and more customers are now preferring green travel and are willing to pay for intelligent functions. In 2022, top 3 players in the EV market worldwide were BYD, Tesla, and SAIC-GM-Wuling, with Tesla falling behind BYD. Due to the emergence of more and more electric models from other players, Tesla’s market share has continuously eroded, falling from 17% in 2019 to 13% in 2022. It is expected to stabilize at around 10% in the future. Tesla needs to diversify its product line with a cheaper compact car if it is to regain the number one spot. The industry transition will be fast, both opportunities and challenges exist. Only by establishing advantage in advance, can the players get ahead of their competitors and win the final victory. The competition in the EV market is fierce and here are some of IDC’s advice for OEMs to capture opportunities from this market: For more information on IDC’s Worldwide Semiconductor Automotive Ecosystem and Supply Chain Research, please visit this page.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors pricing strategy,https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/,"Continuing our spotlight on electric vehicle companies you may not have heard about yet is Canoo ($GOEV). The California-based EV startup in beautiful south bay is beginning to ramp up production of multiple electric vehicles. With two EVs unveiled and more on the horizon, Canoo is an electric vehicle company to keep an eye on. Canoo was originally founded in 2017 by two former employees of rival EV automaker, Faraday Future. Ulrich Kranz and Stefan Krause originally called the new startup Evelozcity. Within two years, however, the founders decided to pivot to something a bit more simple. According to Stefan Krause, We picked Canoo because it sounds distinctive, looks cool and creates a feeling of both relaxation and movement.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors pricing strategy,https://www.kavout.com/blog/analyst-perspectives-on-canoo-nasdaqgoev-an-investment-evaluation/,"Dec 27, 2023 | Stock Analysis Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), a company within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has been under the scrutiny of analysts and investors alike. In recent times, the stock has experienced significant volatility, prompting a diverse range of opinions regarding its investment potential. This report aims to dissect the prevailing analyst views on Canoo and assess whether it constitutes a good buy, based on the information provided and within the context of the current market environment.    As of the latest available data, Canoo has been the subject of analysis by HC Wainwright and others, with a consensus price target of $2.02, which suggests a substantial upside of 750.91% from its recent trading price. This optimistic forecast is predicated on the assumption of Canoo’s potential to capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and overcome its current challenges. However, the stock’s performance has not been without its setbacks. A report from The Motley Fool highlights that Canoo’s stock price has plummeted by a staggering 99% (Yahoo Finance). This decline raises concerns about the company’s viability and the sustainability of its business model. Despite this, there are signals that Canoo is ramping up production and preparing to make significant deliveries, which could be a turning point for the company’s financial health and stock performance. The EV market has been characterized by heightened enthusiasm, followed by a sobering correction as the initial hype fades. Canoo, like many of its peers, has not been immune to these fluctuations. The company’s stock has suffered as a result, and market sentiment appears to be cautious. Nonetheless, the EV sector remains a high-growth area, and companies that can navigate the production and delivery challenges effectively may be well-positioned to reap long-term rewards. In comparison to its competitors, Canoo’s current market valuation may reflect a disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price. If Canoo can execute its business plan successfully, it could emerge as a competitive player in the EV space, thus justifying the optimistic price targets set by analysts. Canoo’s third-quarter print was promising, indicating that the company may be on the cusp of a turnaround. A positive financial performance and the potential for future growth have led to a ‘Buy’ rating recommendation by some analysts. This perspective is supported by the company’s strategic moves to increase production capacity and readiness to deliver vehicles in large numbers. It is important to note, however, that investing in Canoo carries significant risk. The company’s stock has already experienced a dramatic decline, and while this could present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, it also underscores the potential for further losses if Canoo fails to meet its operational and financial targets. Based on the provided information, it appears that analysts are divided on Canoo’s prospects. While there is a consensus on a high upside potential, the stock’s past performance and the overall volatility of the EV market cannot be ignored. As an analyst, I would opine that Canoo may be considered a speculative buy, with a strong emphasis on the speculative nature of this investment. Investors should approach Canoo with caution and be prepared for the possibility of further volatility. The company’s future success will hinge on its ability to scale production, manage costs, and deliver on its promises to customers and investors. Given these considerations, Canoo could be a good buy for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but it may not be suitable for those seeking stability and predictable returns.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors marketing efforts,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428915-canoo-changes-in-business-change-our-view,"Photo by 3alexd/E+ via Getty Images In a previous article we argued that electric-vehicle maker Canoo's (NASDAQ:GOEV) differentiated technology and go-to-market model would position it favorably in the EV space. The company came public last December following a SPAC merger. On March 29, they released their first financial quarterly report, and it is fair to say that investors weren't happy with the updates that management gave. The company announced a fundamental shift in its go-to-market strategy, away from contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and away from its subscription-model towards focusing on commercial EV opportunities. Shares of Canoo were hit hard after the report, and are down about 65% from the $20 highs we saw back in Jan/Feb, while the company's market cap shrunk to only $1.75bn as of this writing, one of the lowest from a basket of EV upstarts. Data by YCharts When Canoo announced in August 2020 to go public via SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition IV, management laid out an aggressive go-to-market strategy that built on two key pillars: one was the licensing and contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and secondly, the company also planned to sell its different EV-types (including a lifestyle and a multi-purpose delivery vehicle) directly to consumers via a monthly subscription (B2C). For their delivery vehicle the company aims at directly selling them to business in a B2B approach. The focus on these pillars was strongly presented in its SPAC presentation (see some excerpts below): Source: Company presentation The company also put significant focus on the commercial relevance of its contract manufacturing & engineering capabilities, on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology.  Source: Company presentation Both business segments would use the underlying multi-purpose skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture necessary for EVs. The beauty of the manufacturing approach on the basis of the skateboard is that the vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard, a so-called ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce cost and time to market. According to management the skateboard technology would be the first true steer-by-wire solution that would come to market, which would be an important differentiator from competitor offerings.  It needs to be mentioned here that also other EV manufacturers are working on similar technology concepts, including REE Automotive, which is going public through a SPAC with 10x Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC), and private-company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Canoo was planning to contract these manufacturing capabilities to other car manufacturers. Furthermore, management also pivoted towards selling its in-house developed cars via a potentially revolutionary approach, by offering a subscription plan that management claimed would be significantly different from a traditional lease and cost-efficient compared to an ownership model. And the company's plans should not stop here. Management also intended to sell its multi-purpose delivery vehicle in a B2B approach to capture share in the last-mile delivery market, while arguing that the delivery vehicle would offer best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options), and functionally-designed features, compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). The refreshing approach and multiple revenue streams that Canoo's management presented to investors, and the pivot away from the car industry's regular business model definitely drove some of the optimism and hype towards the company. While these were all nice promises, high hopes got crushed when the company announced its first results as a public company. When Canoo announced its first earnings report as a public company on March 29th, the first surprise for many investors was that the company announced key changes to its leadership team. It was announced that Chief financial officer Paul Balciunas would leave the company. Canoo also announced on April 22nd that Tony Aquila will also take on the role of Chief Executive Officer replacing former CEO Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April 30, 2021. While it is not clear as to why former CEO Ulrich Kranz resigned, it gives some bitter taste to the story and we definitely don't like the high leadership turnover. But these were not the only announcements that put pressure on Canoo's stock. The company announced a number of changes, including that it would no longer pursue the contract engineering part of its business. The reason was that the company wants to protect its intellectual property which it seemingly would not be able to do by licensing it to other manufacturers. On the conference call, analyst Craig Irwin asked about the conflicting statements that management gave:   Craig Irwin: Okay. The second question there - there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was - it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license. Tony Aquila: Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started - I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value. While the answer from Tony Aquila eluded to potential IP leakage and the concerns management had that this approach would not be driving the best shareholder value, we are not very happy with the contradictory explanation. This is especially concerning in light of the fact that Canoo initially planned to generate revenue from the contract manufacturing segment of >$500 million by 2025, with a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 (see our calculation here). It's dubious to us why management now suddenly makes a U-turn when the management team should not have provided such bloated numbers leading to its SPAC deal just to give potential investors false promises on what many investors saw as a key differentiator vs. competition. The announced change on the contract engineering front also undermines all hopes from Canoo's earlier announced partnership with Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) while it also puts to rest any hopes for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL). Again, management didn't give a clear answer to questions on their plans during the conference call when asked by analysts:   Joseph Spak: Okay. Well, last one for me, just going back to the decision to deemphasize engineering with the Hyundai arrangement the original one, which I'm assuming that that's now off the table. But if you go back to that release, did say Hyundai gains access to technology, you mentioned IP leakage is one of the potential problems with that arrangement. Can you just talk about, like how do you unwind that sort of memorandum of understanding what work was done? Do you think there was any IP leakage obviously Hyundai is coming out with their own electric vehicle platforms as well? Tony Aquila I think what happened is pretty kind of case in point. So I think the company, just like any adolescent companies, it's learning its way and all of us go through it. But it factored in contract manufacturing based on the labor of engineers, not based on the value of IP, which would have changed the value of that contract significantly. And look, we have experience in this area and we're very focused on if we do work, one, we can protect our IP and we can get the residual value of that in addition to. So it's kind of caused us to say, hey, let's put that on hold. We have so much demand for our three derivatives. Let's get all that work done. And then let's, look at if there is partnerships, partnerships can work in this industry. But contract manufacturing work is as you know is not the best business line to be in. The announced changes in Canoo's strategy don't stop here as management also mentioned that the previously announced subscription model for its direct-to-consumer offerings (lifestyle and sports vehicle) will now only be optional, and are expected to only account for a small part of its revenue going forward, especially since the consumer business will be de-emphasized in favor of commercial opportunities. This is a significant strategy shift as the company initially forecasted subscription revenue to reach almost $2 billion by 2026 (see forecast below). So again, why did management not get to the realization earlier that this would not be the most promising path?  Source: company presentation With all these changes, Canoo is now a fundamentally changed story and a perfect example of why investors should be cautious to believe in pre-SPAC projections. We have made a similar mistake by putting too much trust into management's projections. While we always took a very careful stance at the company's projections, the significant U-turn lead is to sell our shares over the past weeks. Wall Street seems to agree that the fundamental changes in Canoo's business model create many uncertainties to say the least: The recently announced changes imply a fundamental shift in the business and go-to-market strategy. While the core technology of Canoo's multi-purpose platform did not change, it remains a big question mark how the company will use this technology to generate revenue besides in-house manufacturing when they are shying away from building up a contract engineering business. Canoo remains only one very small player amongst many upstarts within the highly competitive EV industry. So deemphasizing potential revenue-generating partnerships will not only create a cash-problem going forward, but will also take off some of the buzz that was generated around the Hyundai, as well as the potential Apple partnership. The recent strategy changes create a high level of uncertainty as to how the company will finally be able to generate revenue. Canoo's business model is currently no more refined or differentiated than it was at its inception. In fact, it appears that management is not sure themselves what the best route to commercialization is. While several of the announced changes could be regarded as logical, i.e. the pivot towards commercial opportunities, the changes introduce further risk around the company's ability to execute. While it's probably worth asking as to how much the initial story really changed it is a fact that two main pillars of the company's initial forecast, i.e. contract engineering and car-subscriptions, which together accounted for a combined total of around $2.5bn in revenue until 2026, will simply be eliminated from the forecast. Since so much has changed and the path to revenue generation is increasingly unclear, we are distancing ourselves from Canoo stock for the foreseeable future. But Canoo's management may still prove their critics wrong with what's left of the company: an intriguing underlying technology and a market cap that is below the initial SPAC valuation and significantly smaller compared to many of its high-flying peers. However, this is simply too much of a gamble for us. So we will be staying on the sidelines on Canoo stock after selling all our shares over the past weeks.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors marketing efforts,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)  See you tomorrow.  Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Published: 12:24 05 Jan 2024 EST    Canoo Inc (NASDAQ:GOEV), a California-based electric vehicle startup, is a “unique commercial and military EV play,” according to analysts at Wedbush initiating coverage of the company on Friday.  The company issued an Outperform rating and a price target of $4, nearly 20x the company’s midday trading price of $0.20. A big part of Canoo's appeal is its position in the last-mile delivery market, the firm noted. The company is partnered with Walmart and has an order book of more than $3 billion along with over $750 million in committed orders, which essentially sells its production until fiscal 2025.  “Canoo is poised for a golden opportunity on the last-mile delivery landscape while the electric battery market continues to heat up,” the analysts wrote. “Demand for lower mileage travel and greener delivery vehicles with average route length decreasing by 34% since 2000 continue to be a theme across the industry.” The company’s first vehicle is the LDV (Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle), which is expected to be produced in two sizes. One is known as the Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle, and the other is the Pickup Truck.  Looking ahead, Canoo is moving toward a production run rate of 20,000 units by the first quarter of 2024 at its Oklahoma City and Pryor, Oklahoma facilities.  “We believe the current climate is favorable for Canoo at this point as we are in the early innings of this $5 trillion market EV opportunity over the next decade with the auto industry is going through one of the biggest transformations not seen since the 1950s,” analysts wrote.  “Although in the infancy stages of its growth story, we believe it is important to keep an eye on this EV manufacturer chipping away at market share as this growth story unfolds.” Sign up to receive alerts and news direct to your inbox      Hive Digital Technologies CEO Aydin Kilic joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the company's earnings report for the third quarter.

Published: 12:24 05 Jan 2024 EST    Canoo Inc (NASDAQ:GOEV), a California-based electric vehicle startup, is a “unique commercial and military EV play,” according to analysts at Wedbush initiating coverage of the company on Friday.  The company issued an Outperform rating and a price target of $4, nearly 20x the company’s midday trading price of $0.20. A big part of Canoo's appeal is its position in the last-mile delivery market, the firm noted. The company is partnered with Walmart and has an order book of more than $3 billion along with over $750 million in committed orders, which essentially sells its production until fiscal 2025.  “Canoo is poised for a golden opportunity on the last-mile delivery landscape while the electric battery market continues to heat up,” the analysts wrote. “Demand for lower mileage travel and greener delivery vehicles with average route length decreasing by 34% since 2000 continue to be a theme across the industry.” The company’s first vehicle is the LDV (Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle), which is expected to be produced in two sizes. One is known as the Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle, and the other is the Pickup Truck.  Looking ahead, Canoo is moving toward a production run rate of 20,000 units by the first quarter of 2024 at its Oklahoma City and Pryor, Oklahoma facilities.  “We believe the current climate is favorable for Canoo at this point as we are in the early innings of this $5 trillion market EV opportunity over the next decade with the auto industry is going through one of the biggest transformations not seen since the 1950s,” analysts wrote.  “Although in the infancy stages of its growth story, we believe it is important to keep an eye on this EV manufacturer chipping away at market share as this growth story unfolds.” Sign up to receive alerts and news direct to your inbox      Hive Digital Technologies CEO Aydin Kilic joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the company's earnings report for the third quarter.

Learn More Tesla (TSLA -0.25%) defied the odds and upended the auto sector, effectively proving that electric vehicles (EVs) were a viable product. Today, every major car company is working on EVs. But there are also a lot of upstart EV makers that want to follow in Tesla's tire tracks. One of those startups is Canoo (GOEV -3.16%). How likely is this EV maker to succeed? The odds are against it and there are at least three reasons it probably won't.  At this point, Tesla has a whole lineup of autos to sell, from an SUV to a sedan, with a pickup truck in the works. It produced 440,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023, with deliveries of 422,000. While not exactly the largest automaker on the planet, it is clearly well-established.  Image source: Getty Images. Canoo is hoping to produce 20,000 cars in all of 2023, with the goal of doubling that in 2024. But even if it does hit these production targets, it will still be just a fraction of the size of Tesla. Meanwhile, it not only has to compete with Tesla, but also all of the other major automakers that are quickly ramping up their EV capacity. The EV niche is far more crowded than it was when Tesla started out, and that makes standing out today far more difficult. In the first quarter of 2023, Tesla produced revenue of $23.3 billion, up from $18.8 billion in the same quarter of the prior year (auto sales make up around 85% of the top line). Earnings per share came in at $0.73, down from $0.95, at least partly due to swiftly rising costs. But after a long period of red ink as it built its business up, Tesla is a very profitable company today. Canoo's first quarter produced another gusher of red ink. It listed no revenue (zero!) and posted a per-share loss of $0.22. There are some caveats. For example, the California-based company is basically still building its EV business, and you have to spend money to do that before you can start selling products to produce revenue. That is exactly what Tesla did, so the loss isn't exactly unexpected. The loss was also down from a per-share loss of $0.54 in the first quarter of 2022. So in some respects, things are getting better. But the company still has a long way to go before it is sustainably profitable. At this point, Tesla doesn't have nearly as much to prove as it did when it was a start-up like Canoo. In fact, as long as the company doesn't make a huge misstep, it looks like it is here to stay, with ample access to the capital markets to support long-term growth. The same thing can't be said of Canoo. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Canoo had $6.7 million in cash, down from $36.5 million in the year-ago period. That's a very material drop for a company that still has to spend huge sums of cash to build out its business. That fact is highlighted in the company's 10-Q, in which it stated: ""Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding or do not have access to additional capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations."" Canoo could come up with the money it needs, but with the stock down more than 95% from its 2021 highs, selling more stock isn't an investor-friendly option. And with so little cash and the ongoing red ink, debt markets might not be too friendly, either. The company is likely to have to pay dearly for any additional funding at this point, which will limit its earnings and growth potential. If it doesn't find that funding, meanwhile, there's a very real chance that Canoo will go out of business.  Investors could argue that Canoo's vehicles are so wonderful that the company will be successful. Unfortunately, having a superior product doesn't guarantee success. (Betamax lost out to VHS, to cite a famous example.) And even if the EV maker does get its production up and running as it hopes, it still has to compete within a very crowded EV field. Canoo putting a going-concern statement into its Securities and Exchange Commission filing is a very worrying sign that investors should not take likely. At this point, it looks like Canoo will be lucky to survive, let alone take on an EV giant like Tesla. Only the most aggressive investors should even consider the stock, and even they should tread with extreme caution. Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Identify the key trends in Canoo EV market,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)  See you tomorrow.  Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Identify the key trends in Canoo EV market,https://carbuzz.com/news/canoo-could-be-the-key-to-apples-car-making-dreams,"Apple may buy Canoo in a bid to get its own EV off the ground. The success of electric vehicles has really taken off in the last decade, and we have vehicles like the Tesla Model 3 to thank for the wider adoption of EVs. As the world's most valuable automaker, Tesla is making everyone else green with envy, which is why so many are looking to take a slice of the EV pie for themselves. But as many are learning the hard way, it's not nearly as easy as it looks. Apple has been trying and failing to produce its first-ever car, and startup Canoo has also struggled to gain any momentum. But perhaps the key to success is to join forces, and according to a new report from Bloomberg, that may just be in the cards. According to ""a person close to both Apple and Canoo,"" Apple may not be interested in Canoo's technology, but rather its engineers, as Canoo has a number of staff members who have expertise in car interior and exterior design, software, drivetrains, battery technology, and automotive manufacturing, while Apple itself has already poached Canoo's former CEO, Ulrich Kranz, and a number of former Canoo engineers. If this does indeed happen, it appears that Apple would go ahead with its own vision for the Apple Car and would simply use Canoo's human resources to make sure that the car is good enough for mass production. For a tech giant that has no track record in automotive manufacturing, a deal with a relatively experienced automaker could be just the push it needs to finally realize its goals. An acquisition by Apple would certainly benefit the company that created the iPhone, but what benefit would there be for Canoo? After all, its car - the Lifestyle Vehicle - would likely be scrapped. Well, Canoo doesn't seem to have much of a choice: it has been bleeding talent for a long time now, and like Apple, it has failed to make any lasting partnerships with existing automakers stick. With the money of Apple and the engineering know-how of Canoo, a new EV could finally enter the market. Of course, Apple still has a long way to go if it wants to achieve its lofty ambitions of releasing a self-driving car by 2025, but perhaps the input of Canoo will help get the basics of an EV out of the way, allowing Apple to focus on autonomous driving software. We'll bring you more news on this potential deal as we get it."

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond Canoo's control. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or Canoo's assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so unless required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.

Identify the change in consumer behaviour in Canoo EV market,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428915-canoo-changes-in-business-change-our-view,"Photo by 3alexd/E+ via Getty Images In a previous article we argued that electric-vehicle maker Canoo's (NASDAQ:GOEV) differentiated technology and go-to-market model would position it favorably in the EV space. The company came public last December following a SPAC merger. On March 29, they released their first financial quarterly report, and it is fair to say that investors weren't happy with the updates that management gave. The company announced a fundamental shift in its go-to-market strategy, away from contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and away from its subscription-model towards focusing on commercial EV opportunities. Shares of Canoo were hit hard after the report, and are down about 65% from the $20 highs we saw back in Jan/Feb, while the company's market cap shrunk to only $1.75bn as of this writing, one of the lowest from a basket of EV upstarts. Data by YCharts When Canoo announced in August 2020 to go public via SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition IV, management laid out an aggressive go-to-market strategy that built on two key pillars: one was the licensing and contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and secondly, the company also planned to sell its different EV-types (including a lifestyle and a multi-purpose delivery vehicle) directly to consumers via a monthly subscription (B2C). For their delivery vehicle the company aims at directly selling them to business in a B2B approach. The focus on these pillars was strongly presented in its SPAC presentation (see some excerpts below): Source: Company presentation The company also put significant focus on the commercial relevance of its contract manufacturing & engineering capabilities, on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology.  Source: Company presentation Both business segments would use the underlying multi-purpose skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture necessary for EVs. The beauty of the manufacturing approach on the basis of the skateboard is that the vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard, a so-called ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce cost and time to market. According to management the skateboard technology would be the first true steer-by-wire solution that would come to market, which would be an important differentiator from competitor offerings.  It needs to be mentioned here that also other EV manufacturers are working on similar technology concepts, including REE Automotive, which is going public through a SPAC with 10x Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC), and private-company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Canoo was planning to contract these manufacturing capabilities to other car manufacturers. Furthermore, management also pivoted towards selling its in-house developed cars via a potentially revolutionary approach, by offering a subscription plan that management claimed would be significantly different from a traditional lease and cost-efficient compared to an ownership model. And the company's plans should not stop here. Management also intended to sell its multi-purpose delivery vehicle in a B2B approach to capture share in the last-mile delivery market, while arguing that the delivery vehicle would offer best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options), and functionally-designed features, compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). The refreshing approach and multiple revenue streams that Canoo's management presented to investors, and the pivot away from the car industry's regular business model definitely drove some of the optimism and hype towards the company. While these were all nice promises, high hopes got crushed when the company announced its first results as a public company. When Canoo announced its first earnings report as a public company on March 29th, the first surprise for many investors was that the company announced key changes to its leadership team. It was announced that Chief financial officer Paul Balciunas would leave the company. Canoo also announced on April 22nd that Tony Aquila will also take on the role of Chief Executive Officer replacing former CEO Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April 30, 2021. While it is not clear as to why former CEO Ulrich Kranz resigned, it gives some bitter taste to the story and we definitely don't like the high leadership turnover. But these were not the only announcements that put pressure on Canoo's stock. The company announced a number of changes, including that it would no longer pursue the contract engineering part of its business. The reason was that the company wants to protect its intellectual property which it seemingly would not be able to do by licensing it to other manufacturers. On the conference call, analyst Craig Irwin asked about the conflicting statements that management gave:   Craig Irwin: Okay. The second question there - there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was - it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license. Tony Aquila: Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started - I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value. While the answer from Tony Aquila eluded to potential IP leakage and the concerns management had that this approach would not be driving the best shareholder value, we are not very happy with the contradictory explanation. This is especially concerning in light of the fact that Canoo initially planned to generate revenue from the contract manufacturing segment of >$500 million by 2025, with a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 (see our calculation here). It's dubious to us why management now suddenly makes a U-turn when the management team should not have provided such bloated numbers leading to its SPAC deal just to give potential investors false promises on what many investors saw as a key differentiator vs. competition. The announced change on the contract engineering front also undermines all hopes from Canoo's earlier announced partnership with Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) while it also puts to rest any hopes for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL). Again, management didn't give a clear answer to questions on their plans during the conference call when asked by analysts:   Joseph Spak: Okay. Well, last one for me, just going back to the decision to deemphasize engineering with the Hyundai arrangement the original one, which I'm assuming that that's now off the table. But if you go back to that release, did say Hyundai gains access to technology, you mentioned IP leakage is one of the potential problems with that arrangement. Can you just talk about, like how do you unwind that sort of memorandum of understanding what work was done? Do you think there was any IP leakage obviously Hyundai is coming out with their own electric vehicle platforms as well? Tony Aquila I think what happened is pretty kind of case in point. So I think the company, just like any adolescent companies, it's learning its way and all of us go through it. But it factored in contract manufacturing based on the labor of engineers, not based on the value of IP, which would have changed the value of that contract significantly. And look, we have experience in this area and we're very focused on if we do work, one, we can protect our IP and we can get the residual value of that in addition to. So it's kind of caused us to say, hey, let's put that on hold. We have so much demand for our three derivatives. Let's get all that work done. And then let's, look at if there is partnerships, partnerships can work in this industry. But contract manufacturing work is as you know is not the best business line to be in. The announced changes in Canoo's strategy don't stop here as management also mentioned that the previously announced subscription model for its direct-to-consumer offerings (lifestyle and sports vehicle) will now only be optional, and are expected to only account for a small part of its revenue going forward, especially since the consumer business will be de-emphasized in favor of commercial opportunities. This is a significant strategy shift as the company initially forecasted subscription revenue to reach almost $2 billion by 2026 (see forecast below). So again, why did management not get to the realization earlier that this would not be the most promising path?  Source: company presentation With all these changes, Canoo is now a fundamentally changed story and a perfect example of why investors should be cautious to believe in pre-SPAC projections. We have made a similar mistake by putting too much trust into management's projections. While we always took a very careful stance at the company's projections, the significant U-turn lead is to sell our shares over the past weeks. Wall Street seems to agree that the fundamental changes in Canoo's business model create many uncertainties to say the least: The recently announced changes imply a fundamental shift in the business and go-to-market strategy. While the core technology of Canoo's multi-purpose platform did not change, it remains a big question mark how the company will use this technology to generate revenue besides in-house manufacturing when they are shying away from building up a contract engineering business. Canoo remains only one very small player amongst many upstarts within the highly competitive EV industry. So deemphasizing potential revenue-generating partnerships will not only create a cash-problem going forward, but will also take off some of the buzz that was generated around the Hyundai, as well as the potential Apple partnership. The recent strategy changes create a high level of uncertainty as to how the company will finally be able to generate revenue. Canoo's business model is currently no more refined or differentiated than it was at its inception. In fact, it appears that management is not sure themselves what the best route to commercialization is. While several of the announced changes could be regarded as logical, i.e. the pivot towards commercial opportunities, the changes introduce further risk around the company's ability to execute. While it's probably worth asking as to how much the initial story really changed it is a fact that two main pillars of the company's initial forecast, i.e. contract engineering and car-subscriptions, which together accounted for a combined total of around $2.5bn in revenue until 2026, will simply be eliminated from the forecast. Since so much has changed and the path to revenue generation is increasingly unclear, we are distancing ourselves from Canoo stock for the foreseeable future. But Canoo's management may still prove their critics wrong with what's left of the company: an intriguing underlying technology and a market cap that is below the initial SPAC valuation and significantly smaller compared to many of its high-flying peers. However, this is simply too much of a gamble for us. So we will be staying on the sidelines on Canoo stock after selling all our shares over the past weeks.

Identify the change in consumer behaviour in Canoo EV market,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Learn More Tesla (TSLA -0.25%) defied the odds and upended the auto sector, effectively proving that electric vehicles (EVs) were a viable product. Today, every major car company is working on EVs. But there are also a lot of upstart EV makers that want to follow in Tesla's tire tracks. One of those startups is Canoo (GOEV -3.16%). How likely is this EV maker to succeed? The odds are against it and there are at least three reasons it probably won't.  At this point, Tesla has a whole lineup of autos to sell, from an SUV to a sedan, with a pickup truck in the works. It produced 440,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023, with deliveries of 422,000. While not exactly the largest automaker on the planet, it is clearly well-established.  Image source: Getty Images. Canoo is hoping to produce 20,000 cars in all of 2023, with the goal of doubling that in 2024. But even if it does hit these production targets, it will still be just a fraction of the size of Tesla. Meanwhile, it not only has to compete with Tesla, but also all of the other major automakers that are quickly ramping up their EV capacity. The EV niche is far more crowded than it was when Tesla started out, and that makes standing out today far more difficult. In the first quarter of 2023, Tesla produced revenue of $23.3 billion, up from $18.8 billion in the same quarter of the prior year (auto sales make up around 85% of the top line). Earnings per share came in at $0.73, down from $0.95, at least partly due to swiftly rising costs. But after a long period of red ink as it built its business up, Tesla is a very profitable company today. Canoo's first quarter produced another gusher of red ink. It listed no revenue (zero!) and posted a per-share loss of $0.22. There are some caveats. For example, the California-based company is basically still building its EV business, and you have to spend money to do that before you can start selling products to produce revenue. That is exactly what Tesla did, so the loss isn't exactly unexpected. The loss was also down from a per-share loss of $0.54 in the first quarter of 2022. So in some respects, things are getting better. But the company still has a long way to go before it is sustainably profitable. At this point, Tesla doesn't have nearly as much to prove as it did when it was a start-up like Canoo. In fact, as long as the company doesn't make a huge misstep, it looks like it is here to stay, with ample access to the capital markets to support long-term growth. The same thing can't be said of Canoo. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Canoo had $6.7 million in cash, down from $36.5 million in the year-ago period. That's a very material drop for a company that still has to spend huge sums of cash to build out its business. That fact is highlighted in the company's 10-Q, in which it stated: ""Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding or do not have access to additional capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations."" Canoo could come up with the money it needs, but with the stock down more than 95% from its 2021 highs, selling more stock isn't an investor-friendly option. And with so little cash and the ongoing red ink, debt markets might not be too friendly, either. The company is likely to have to pay dearly for any additional funding at this point, which will limit its earnings and growth potential. If it doesn't find that funding, meanwhile, there's a very real chance that Canoo will go out of business.  Investors could argue that Canoo's vehicles are so wonderful that the company will be successful. Unfortunately, having a superior product doesn't guarantee success. (Betamax lost out to VHS, to cite a famous example.) And even if the EV maker does get its production up and running as it hopes, it still has to compete within a very crowded EV field. Canoo putting a going-concern statement into its Securities and Exchange Commission filing is a very worrying sign that investors should not take likely. At this point, it looks like Canoo will be lucky to survive, let alone take on an EV giant like Tesla. Only the most aggressive investors should even consider the stock, and even they should tread with extreme caution. Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Identify the change in consumer behaviour in Canoo EV market,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/08/10/how-the-increase-in-electric-vehicles-is-affecting-consumer-behavior/,"Joel Li is the Founder and CEO of EV.com. A young entrepreneur building the next generation of Autotrader.   Digital transformation is impacting every industry, and the automotive industry is no exception. With electric and hybrid vehicles on the road increasing significantly over the past 10 years, the automotive industry is experiencing the biggest revolution since the invention of the Model T. There were more than 10 million electric vehicles (EV)s on the road in 2020, and with this shift in car buying trends comes new consumer behavior. The manufacturers and dealerships that understand this shift—and evolve simultaneously with their sales, marketing, and customer experience—will be the ones that find the most success. Those buying EVs aren’t researching miles per gallon and sports packages. Instead, consumers are checking battery range, charging networks, and technology functionality. What actually matters to the consumer has changed, and thus, their buying behaviors. An increased awareness around sustainability, as well as a general distaste in and distrust of the dealership experience, are just two reasons why EVs are shaking up the auto business. Millennials, like myself, simply don’t want to engage in the traditional car-buying experience. We are happy to trade five-hour car dealership experiences for 10 clicks or less to buy a car online. A recent New York Times article shared that millennials were almost twice as likely to shop for and buy a car completely online. They want more transparency into car pricing and an easier, less convoluted buying experience. The in-person sales pitch at the dealership just isn’t working for this generation. The manufacturers and dealerships that embrace this new way of thinking have the best chances of outmaneuvering their competition. Recent studies show that the average EV owner has remained the same over the past 10 years,: 40-55 year old males with an annual household income of more than $100,000. But as sales continue to increase at a fast rate, year over year, it’s likely new trends and demographics will emerge. With EV prices likely to become more affordable in coming years, we’ll probably see more millennials get behind the wheel of a battery-powered car. In recent research, The Fuels Institute found a collection of trends that leads a consumer to ultimately make a purchase: “Affordability, availability, and familiarity appear to be amongst the key factors influencing likelihood of EV purchases.” Overall, McKinsey predicts an industry- and consumer-wide adoption of EVs in the next decade. “In 2030, the share of electrified vehicles could range from 10 percent to 50 percent of new-vehicle sales. Adoption rates will be highest in developed dense cities with strict emission regulations and consumer incentives (tax breaks, special parking and driving privileges, discounted electricity pricing, etc).” The more environmentally focused a city or state, the more likely that area will have higher numbers of EVs. Interestingly, one of the biggest concerns for current and potential EV buyers is “range anxiety.” According to Kalibrate, more than 50% of drivers are worried that an EV will run out of charge while traveling. A lack of charging stations, as well as faulty or broken stations, is also concerning for car buyers contemplating an EV. With most EV drivers recharging daily or once every two days, and usually at home or at a workplace parking lot, the worry is less around regular commutes to work. In fact, according to Fuel Institute, “most EV fleet customers today (2020) operate in a hub-and-spoke network and exclusively recharge their vehicles overnight at their home base.” Drivers are much more concerned about running out of charge on longer trips when planned stops to recharge are necessary. Once the decision to buy an EV is made, one of the first considerations is the network of charging stations. And research shows that charging infrastructure remains a barrier. According to McKinsey, “Sales penetration will be slower in small towns and rural areas with lower levels of charging infrastructure and higher dependency on driving range.” As the automotive industry continues to navigate the digital revolutions, it’s imperative for manufacturers and dealerships to evolve with the changing times. Future success depends on adopting new sales and marketing strategies and understanding the dynamics needs of the customer.

Identify the technological advancement in Canoo EV market,https://www.motortrend.com/news/canoo-technology-advances-motors-batteries-manufacturing/,"Canoo's long march toward building a salable electric vehicle continues, but while you might be familiar with its upcoming LV electric van and Pickup truck models, here's an update on advances the company is working on, gleaned fresh from our first drive opportunity in the LV. CEO Tony Aquila describes Canoo as a Technology Equipment Manufacturer, not an Original Equipment Manufacturer. Among the distinctions, he prefers to treat the many component technologies that comprise a Canoo vehicle as businesses in themselves. Key component technologies such as the batteries, powertrain, the 12-volt operating system, and the operating system that makes it all work are not only designed and developed in-house, they're viewed as potential revenue generators in and of themselves. Canoo is going to market with 2170 cylindrical cells like those used on the Tesla Model 3, but Canoo's patented system of integrating, controlling, and cooling them involves a liquid-cooled casting into which the bottoms of two layers of 132 cells get inserted to form a module. Atop each cell is a cell-sensing board (CSB) which monitors and reports on the health of each cell. These modules get individually incorporated into the skateboard, such that if a CSB determines a cell has died or compromises a module, it can be replaced individually. They're not glued in as an integral all-or-nothing pack, as with some brands. Canoo holds 58 patents on its permanent-magnet rotor and stator design, materials, and cooling procedure, which is basically a water jacket cooling the stator with oil sprayed on the end windings. And as with several others, the motor is integrated with its gear-reduction drive, inverter, and even the compressor that handles the cabin AC and the chiller used to thermally manage the electrical system in hot weather. This unitized design makes it compact and easily serviceable. By designing all its own software and operating system in-house early on in the design process, Canoo was able to optimize all systems to deliver more functionality with reduced power draw and utilizing fewer computer chips—great for both cost and supply-chain resiliency. And with a fully steer-by-wire chassis in need of serious redundancy, the system includes two 12-volt batteries and a completely mirrored 12-volt architecture to ensure safety. Canoo claims its total 12-volt operating system power draw is on the order of 200 watts, which favorably compares with some competitors' systems' 1-kW 12-volt draw. The system is also easily accessible in case the 12-volt batteries ever go flat (they're needed to wake the high-voltage system, so yes, it's important to be able to ""jump-start"" an EV). One key TEM mandate is to ship, store, and assemble as few things as possible. Fine tuning of the assembly process—which will incorporate automatic guided vehicles and more assembly stations in the roomier Oklahoma assembly plant—helped reduce the total number of parts for assembly to about 1,600 for the LV. With a corporate mandate to maximize value for second and third owners, Canoo endeavors to tests all systems to failure, rather than to a pass a series of established durability tests. By failing most components, the company not only gets the chance to redesign around failure modes, it also can fine-tune design for repairability. Oh, and part of the durability testing regimen for the Lifestyle Vehicle range has included thousands of miles in last-mile delivery duty."

Published: 12:24 05 Jan 2024 EST    Canoo Inc (NASDAQ:GOEV), a California-based electric vehicle startup, is a “unique commercial and military EV play,” according to analysts at Wedbush initiating coverage of the company on Friday.  The company issued an Outperform rating and a price target of $4, nearly 20x the company’s midday trading price of $0.20. A big part of Canoo's appeal is its position in the last-mile delivery market, the firm noted. The company is partnered with Walmart and has an order book of more than $3 billion along with over $750 million in committed orders, which essentially sells its production until fiscal 2025.  “Canoo is poised for a golden opportunity on the last-mile delivery landscape while the electric battery market continues to heat up,” the analysts wrote. “Demand for lower mileage travel and greener delivery vehicles with average route length decreasing by 34% since 2000 continue to be a theme across the industry.” The company’s first vehicle is the LDV (Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle), which is expected to be produced in two sizes. One is known as the Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle, and the other is the Pickup Truck.  Looking ahead, Canoo is moving toward a production run rate of 20,000 units by the first quarter of 2024 at its Oklahoma City and Pryor, Oklahoma facilities.  “We believe the current climate is favorable for Canoo at this point as we are in the early innings of this $5 trillion market EV opportunity over the next decade with the auto industry is going through one of the biggest transformations not seen since the 1950s,” analysts wrote.  “Although in the infancy stages of its growth story, we believe it is important to keep an eye on this EV manufacturer chipping away at market share as this growth story unfolds.” Sign up to receive alerts and news direct to your inbox      Hive Digital Technologies CEO Aydin Kilic joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the company's earnings report for the third quarter.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business.

Identify the shift in competitive advancement in Canoo EV market,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428915-canoo-changes-in-business-change-our-view,"Photo by 3alexd/E+ via Getty Images In a previous article we argued that electric-vehicle maker Canoo's (NASDAQ:GOEV) differentiated technology and go-to-market model would position it favorably in the EV space. The company came public last December following a SPAC merger. On March 29, they released their first financial quarterly report, and it is fair to say that investors weren't happy with the updates that management gave. The company announced a fundamental shift in its go-to-market strategy, away from contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and away from its subscription-model towards focusing on commercial EV opportunities. Shares of Canoo were hit hard after the report, and are down about 65% from the $20 highs we saw back in Jan/Feb, while the company's market cap shrunk to only $1.75bn as of this writing, one of the lowest from a basket of EV upstarts. Data by YCharts When Canoo announced in August 2020 to go public via SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition IV, management laid out an aggressive go-to-market strategy that built on two key pillars: one was the licensing and contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and secondly, the company also planned to sell its different EV-types (including a lifestyle and a multi-purpose delivery vehicle) directly to consumers via a monthly subscription (B2C). For their delivery vehicle the company aims at directly selling them to business in a B2B approach. The focus on these pillars was strongly presented in its SPAC presentation (see some excerpts below): Source: Company presentation The company also put significant focus on the commercial relevance of its contract manufacturing & engineering capabilities, on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology.  Source: Company presentation Both business segments would use the underlying multi-purpose skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture necessary for EVs. The beauty of the manufacturing approach on the basis of the skateboard is that the vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard, a so-called ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce cost and time to market. According to management the skateboard technology would be the first true steer-by-wire solution that would come to market, which would be an important differentiator from competitor offerings.  It needs to be mentioned here that also other EV manufacturers are working on similar technology concepts, including REE Automotive, which is going public through a SPAC with 10x Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC), and private-company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Canoo was planning to contract these manufacturing capabilities to other car manufacturers. Furthermore, management also pivoted towards selling its in-house developed cars via a potentially revolutionary approach, by offering a subscription plan that management claimed would be significantly different from a traditional lease and cost-efficient compared to an ownership model. And the company's plans should not stop here. Management also intended to sell its multi-purpose delivery vehicle in a B2B approach to capture share in the last-mile delivery market, while arguing that the delivery vehicle would offer best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options), and functionally-designed features, compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). The refreshing approach and multiple revenue streams that Canoo's management presented to investors, and the pivot away from the car industry's regular business model definitely drove some of the optimism and hype towards the company. While these were all nice promises, high hopes got crushed when the company announced its first results as a public company. When Canoo announced its first earnings report as a public company on March 29th, the first surprise for many investors was that the company announced key changes to its leadership team. It was announced that Chief financial officer Paul Balciunas would leave the company. Canoo also announced on April 22nd that Tony Aquila will also take on the role of Chief Executive Officer replacing former CEO Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April 30, 2021. While it is not clear as to why former CEO Ulrich Kranz resigned, it gives some bitter taste to the story and we definitely don't like the high leadership turnover. But these were not the only announcements that put pressure on Canoo's stock. The company announced a number of changes, including that it would no longer pursue the contract engineering part of its business. The reason was that the company wants to protect its intellectual property which it seemingly would not be able to do by licensing it to other manufacturers. On the conference call, analyst Craig Irwin asked about the conflicting statements that management gave:   Craig Irwin: Okay. The second question there - there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was - it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license. Tony Aquila: Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started - I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value. While the answer from Tony Aquila eluded to potential IP leakage and the concerns management had that this approach would not be driving the best shareholder value, we are not very happy with the contradictory explanation. This is especially concerning in light of the fact that Canoo initially planned to generate revenue from the contract manufacturing segment of >$500 million by 2025, with a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 (see our calculation here). It's dubious to us why management now suddenly makes a U-turn when the management team should not have provided such bloated numbers leading to its SPAC deal just to give potential investors false promises on what many investors saw as a key differentiator vs. competition. The announced change on the contract engineering front also undermines all hopes from Canoo's earlier announced partnership with Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) while it also puts to rest any hopes for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL). Again, management didn't give a clear answer to questions on their plans during the conference call when asked by analysts:   Joseph Spak: Okay. Well, last one for me, just going back to the decision to deemphasize engineering with the Hyundai arrangement the original one, which I'm assuming that that's now off the table. But if you go back to that release, did say Hyundai gains access to technology, you mentioned IP leakage is one of the potential problems with that arrangement. Can you just talk about, like how do you unwind that sort of memorandum of understanding what work was done? Do you think there was any IP leakage obviously Hyundai is coming out with their own electric vehicle platforms as well? Tony Aquila I think what happened is pretty kind of case in point. So I think the company, just like any adolescent companies, it's learning its way and all of us go through it. But it factored in contract manufacturing based on the labor of engineers, not based on the value of IP, which would have changed the value of that contract significantly. And look, we have experience in this area and we're very focused on if we do work, one, we can protect our IP and we can get the residual value of that in addition to. So it's kind of caused us to say, hey, let's put that on hold. We have so much demand for our three derivatives. Let's get all that work done. And then let's, look at if there is partnerships, partnerships can work in this industry. But contract manufacturing work is as you know is not the best business line to be in. The announced changes in Canoo's strategy don't stop here as management also mentioned that the previously announced subscription model for its direct-to-consumer offerings (lifestyle and sports vehicle) will now only be optional, and are expected to only account for a small part of its revenue going forward, especially since the consumer business will be de-emphasized in favor of commercial opportunities. This is a significant strategy shift as the company initially forecasted subscription revenue to reach almost $2 billion by 2026 (see forecast below). So again, why did management not get to the realization earlier that this would not be the most promising path?  Source: company presentation With all these changes, Canoo is now a fundamentally changed story and a perfect example of why investors should be cautious to believe in pre-SPAC projections. We have made a similar mistake by putting too much trust into management's projections. While we always took a very careful stance at the company's projections, the significant U-turn lead is to sell our shares over the past weeks. Wall Street seems to agree that the fundamental changes in Canoo's business model create many uncertainties to say the least: The recently announced changes imply a fundamental shift in the business and go-to-market strategy. While the core technology of Canoo's multi-purpose platform did not change, it remains a big question mark how the company will use this technology to generate revenue besides in-house manufacturing when they are shying away from building up a contract engineering business. Canoo remains only one very small player amongst many upstarts within the highly competitive EV industry. So deemphasizing potential revenue-generating partnerships will not only create a cash-problem going forward, but will also take off some of the buzz that was generated around the Hyundai, as well as the potential Apple partnership. The recent strategy changes create a high level of uncertainty as to how the company will finally be able to generate revenue. Canoo's business model is currently no more refined or differentiated than it was at its inception. In fact, it appears that management is not sure themselves what the best route to commercialization is. While several of the announced changes could be regarded as logical, i.e. the pivot towards commercial opportunities, the changes introduce further risk around the company's ability to execute. While it's probably worth asking as to how much the initial story really changed it is a fact that two main pillars of the company's initial forecast, i.e. contract engineering and car-subscriptions, which together accounted for a combined total of around $2.5bn in revenue until 2026, will simply be eliminated from the forecast. Since so much has changed and the path to revenue generation is increasingly unclear, we are distancing ourselves from Canoo stock for the foreseeable future. But Canoo's management may still prove their critics wrong with what's left of the company: an intriguing underlying technology and a market cap that is below the initial SPAC valuation and significantly smaller compared to many of its high-flying peers. However, this is simply too much of a gamble for us. So we will be staying on the sidelines on Canoo stock after selling all our shares over the past weeks.

Identify the shift in competitive advancement in Canoo EV market,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high. "

Identify the shift in competitive advancement in Canoo EV market,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4473197-canoo-goev-high-potential-electric-vehicle-stock,"swissmediavision/E+ via Getty Images swissmediavision/E+ via Getty Images Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) is set to launch its first product in a year time from now. Attractive designs, multipurpose platform, and multiple revenue streams differentiate the company from its competitors. Moreover, compared to other EV stocks, the valuation of Canoo looks attractive. The stock's price should follow the company's development path in next one to two years. Founded in 2017, Canoo has developed a technology platform that enables it to bring new consumer as well as commercial vehicles to market faster and at lower cost than others. The product portfolio of the company includes Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle, The Lifestyle Vehicle, and Canoo Pickup. Canoo has reassembled its board and management team after various changes in the management, including exit of its founders. The company's current management team includes well experienced professionals from different domains. The CEO of the company, Tony Aquila, is a serial entrepreneur and inventor with 100+ patents. As a start-up company, Canoo is still positioning to execute its plan on vehicle launch. The company's initial upcoming vehicles pipeline includes:  Source: Canoo. The Lifestyle Vehicle: Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in the second half of 2022. The vehicle offers an estimated EPA range of 250+ miles, electric motor of 300hp, and 20% to 80% of charging in 28 minutes. The spacious seven-passenger vehicle has comfortable seats comparable to Volkswagen's Golf. Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle: The product is expected to offer spatial efficiency, making it suitable for operating in congested urban environments and small business uses. The specialty of the cabin built by the company's platform is that it can be modified to facilitate dimensions, performance, and cost requirements. The vehicle is expected to be launched in 2023. Canoo Pickup: It is an extended cab vehicle, which offers the performance specifications for professional use. Revealed in March 2021, the delivery of the pickup vehicle is estimated to begin in early 2023. A couple of factors differentiate Canoo from its competitors and may potentially give it an edge over others. To begin with, it is focusing on minivans or SUVs (The Lifestyle Vehicle), delivery vans, and pickup trucks, which are the most profitable segments in the automobile sector. Secondly, Canoo's multi-purpose platform allows it to develop new vehicle variants quickly and cost-effectively. The re-use of the platform allows the company to save significantly on labor and other costs. The vehicle design is vertically integrated to focus on efficiency and secured connectivity layer.  Source: Canoo's Investor Presentation, August 2021. The third key factor is that Canoo plans to focus on providing software, upfitting, and accessories across the entire life cycle of the vehicle. According to Canoo, there is as much as 70% to 80% of a vehicle's lifetime profit opportunity from owners 2 to 4. Most of the auto companies lose this opportunity by focusing only on the first buyer. This will also allow Canoo to use car data more effectively and increase its monetization opportunity. The company estimates to collect 1-2 terabytes of raw data per day per connected vehicle. Its products have harmonized hardware and software with superior cleansing, which will allow it to generate actionable data. The Canoo app has functionalities to schedule mobile services such as charging station reservations / payments, over-the-air updates and provide instant quotes for insurance, financing, and vehicle valuation services. Canoo also claims that its vehicles will be better protected from cyber vulnerabilities. The demand for EVs has grown rapidly in both consumer and commercial segments. According to EVAdoption, the demand for passenger EV in the U.S. is expected to grow at a CAGR of 26% from 2019 to 2028. The growth is expected to be higher in urban areas. The adaption of EVs among businesses, including commercial delivery vehicles, is dramatically increasing as they're pressurized by regulators, consumers, environmental, social, and governance stakeholders to reduce their footprint. The adaption of EVs in commercial delivery is expected to be led by light commercial vehicle segment. According to BloombergNEF, from 2019 to 2028, demand for electric light commercial vehicles will grow at a CAGR of 33% in United States, Europe, and China. Government regulations in many cities, states, and countries are encouraging a shift to EVs from fossil fuel-powered vehicles. The growing threat of climate change is pushing consumers towards EVs. They are also becoming more confident to adopt EVs due improved range and expansion of EV charging infrastructure. As a result, consumers are increasingly switching to EVs as their next vehicles. Due to improved environmental awareness and latest regulatory developments, most of the transportation sector is switching towards low emission, zero-emission, or carbon neutral solution. So, Canoo faces huge competition from well-established legacy automakers as well as new EV manufacturers. Whether customers prefer Canoo's products over competitive offerings remains to be seen. Its potential competitors include General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA), Rivian (RIVN), Nikola (NKLA), Lordstown Motors, and Bollinger Motors. Deliveries of Tesla's CyberTruck is expected to begin in 2022. The company hasn't generated any revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, since its products are still in the pre-commercialization stage. The company has incurred a loss of $80.88 million for the nine-month ended September 30, 2021, and it has incurred a cumulative loss of approximately $429.38 million since incorporation. The company will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter, till it begins product delivery, which is expected to be in Q4 2022. The company has liquidity of $414.9 million as on September 30, 2021, which it believes is sufficient to continue operating activities, including production of lifestyle vehicle, for the next one year. Canoo is still nearly a year away from the start of production. It expects to produce 500 to 1,000 units in 2022. Canoo's market capitalization is higher compared to that of Lordstown Motors and Workhorse Group (WKHS) - both of which are facing ongoing issues. Data by YCharts However, as evident by Rivian IPO, Canoo's stock price and market capitalization may soar if it delivers its first vehicles on time. In the long-term, there would be several other factors that will drive the stock's price. Though Canoo faces several risks and stiff competition, its offerings are attractive. Its technology platform may allow it produce vehicles at a lower cost, while focusing on multiple revenue streams could foster growth and increase profitability. The management team is strong, focused on the development path, and experienced in creating value for shareholders. Canoo's stock price may soar if it delivers its first vehicles on time.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

For investors, please visit investors.canoo.com. Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results   CANOO INC.    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance.

IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

Gather information on Canoo EV revenue,https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/109/canoo-inc-announces-second-quarter-2023-results,"JUSTIN, Texas, Aug. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Canoo Inc. (Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2023.    ""We are pleased to close the chapter involving the legacy SEC matter.  Today we introduced the LDV 190, which has been in development for some time, including in customer trials.  Our facilities are nearing substantial completion as we've achieved a 20,000 unit run rate for our battery module line in Pryor and robotics and assembly line in Oklahoma City for our MPP1 platform. And we closed another Fortune 100 customer agreement to purchase vehicles for its national fleet. We entered the revenue and income generation phase with the advancement of our contract with the Department of Defense, and we delivered vehicles to NASA, "" said Tony Aquila, Chairman and CEO at Canoo. Second Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Second Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook Based upon our current projections, Canoo expects: See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, August 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Los""s is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures.   CANOO INC.   NON GAAP RECONCILIATION TABLE (in thousands)   These non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measure as disclosed below for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA AdjustedNet Loss Net loss $    (70,870) $      (70,870) $     (70,870) $  (164,392) $ (164,392) $    (164,392) Interest expense (income) 2,264 2,264 — (19) (19) — Provision for income taxes — — — — — — Depreciation 4,562 4,562 — 2,892 2,892 — Gain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability — (59) (59) — (9,471) (9,471) Gain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability — (5,623) (5,623) — — — Loss on extinguishment of debt — 949 949 — — — Other income (expense), net — (226) (226) — 378 378 Stock-based compensation — 6,707 6,707 — 20,773 20,773 Adjusted Non-GAAP amount (64,044) (62,296) (69,122) (161,519) (149,839) (152,712) US GAAP net loss per share Basic N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.68) Diluted N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.68) Adjusted Non-GAAP net loss per share (Adjusted EPS): Basic N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.63) Diluted N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.63) Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic N/A N/A 505,576 N/A N/A 242,772 Diluted N/A N/A 505,576 N/A N/A 242,772 Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 EBITDA AdjustedEBITDA Adjusted Net Loss EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss Net loss $  (161,602) $    (161,602) $   (161,602) $  (289,757) $ (289,757) $    (289,757) Interest expense (income) 2,560 2,560 — 9 9 — Provision for income taxes — — — — — — Depreciation 9,137 9,137 — 5,570 5,570 — Gain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability — (2,564) (2,564) — (24,936) (24,936) Gain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability — (22,965) (22,965) — — — Loss on extinguishment of debt — 27,688 27,688 — — — Other income (expense), net — 1,790 1,790 — 395 395 Stock-based compensation — 16,543 16,543 — 41,453 41,453 Adjusted Non-GAAP amount (149,905) (129,413) (141,110) (284,178) (267,266) (272,845) US GAAP net loss per share Basic N/A N/A (0.35) N/A N/A (1.22) Diluted N/A N/A (0.35) N/A N/A (1.22) Adjusted Non-GAAP net loss per share (Adjusted EPS): Basic N/A N/A (0.31) N/A N/A (1.15) Diluted N/A N/A (0.31) N/A N/A (1.15) Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic N/A N/A 462,303 N/A N/A $     238,242 Diluted N/A N/A 462,303 N/A N/A $     238,242   Forward-Looking Statements  The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Published: 12:24 05 Jan 2024 EST    Canoo Inc (NASDAQ:GOEV), a California-based electric vehicle startup, is a “unique commercial and military EV play,” according to analysts at Wedbush initiating coverage of the company on Friday.  The company issued an Outperform rating and a price target of $4, nearly 20x the company’s midday trading price of $0.20. A big part of Canoo's appeal is its position in the last-mile delivery market, the firm noted. The company is partnered with Walmart and has an order book of more than $3 billion along with over $750 million in committed orders, which essentially sells its production until fiscal 2025.  “Canoo is poised for a golden opportunity on the last-mile delivery landscape while the electric battery market continues to heat up,” the analysts wrote. “Demand for lower mileage travel and greener delivery vehicles with average route length decreasing by 34% since 2000 continue to be a theme across the industry.” The company’s first vehicle is the LDV (Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle), which is expected to be produced in two sizes. One is known as the Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle, and the other is the Pickup Truck.  Looking ahead, Canoo is moving toward a production run rate of 20,000 units by the first quarter of 2024 at its Oklahoma City and Pryor, Oklahoma facilities.  “We believe the current climate is favorable for Canoo at this point as we are in the early innings of this $5 trillion market EV opportunity over the next decade with the auto industry is going through one of the biggest transformations not seen since the 1950s,” analysts wrote.  “Although in the infancy stages of its growth story, we believe it is important to keep an eye on this EV manufacturer chipping away at market share as this growth story unfolds.” Sign up to receive alerts and news direct to your inbox      Hive Digital Technologies CEO Aydin Kilic joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the company's earnings report for the third quarter.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Gather information on Canoo EV expense structure,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1132705_ev-startup-canoo-has-a-structural-battery-but-it-s-not-tesla-s-approach,"So far, most electric car batteries are built around a predictable hierarchy: Cells go into modules and modules assemble into a pack. In many cases, the case and internal frame of the pack make up its own rugged structure.  That’s not the case with the California EV startup Canoo, which last week, as part of a lengthy investor presentation, revealed a bit more about its unprecedented battery layout. While the battery isn't structural in the same way that Tesla is planning with upcoming products, the vehicle structure is part of the battery pack and, to some degree, vice versa.     Canoo lineup To help understand Canoo’s approach, Green Car Reports caught up with the company’s CTO, Pete Savagian, on Wednesday. As the former GM EV1 chief engineer, a key GM executive behind the Chevy Volt and Bolt EV, and former VP for product and technology development at Faraday Future, Savagian has helped lay out the foundation for several formative and groundbreaking EVs.  Canoo has previously disclosed that its battery packs will be about 60 kwh and 80 kwh, with the possibility of an entry-level 40-kwh pack.  Those packs consist of a certain number of 2170-format cylindrical cells—exact chemistry and supplier yet to be announced—packaged tightly together as part of a module.  As Savagian described, the battery pack’s multiple modules sit within a sealed cavity—protected from below by a belly panel that’s sealed to the frame and from above by the cabin floor.  “Riding in that cavity are the modules, which are protected by the structure, and the modules themselves are structurally attached to the frame,” explained Savagian. “They actually serve to stiffen, somewhat, the frame and transfer some of the load during a crash event.”  Canoo battery - June 2021 iinvestor presentation As Canoo’s presentation had already hinted, Savagian said that the modules would easily translate to the 4680 cylindrical cells that Tesla proposed, and he told us the company is exploring the concept in more detail.  Each module is interconnected with the cooling system and structurally integrated frame, he said, explaining how the idea can be adapted to other formats. “If we take that structural and thermal backbone and the Canoo BMS system, and go make another module that’s in the same rough form factor, having the same structural attach points, and run the same kind of coolant flow rate and pressure drop,” then the module system allows different cell form factors.  “We’ll be fast followers with battery technology as it matures,” Savagian said. That means the company isn’t planning to exclude pouch cells, which are likely to be the first format in which automotive solid-state cells are widely available.  With pouch cells Savagian says the heat exchange is “a bit different, but they’re not so profoundly different that we can’t extend this concept in some way.” A recent presentation from Savagian and the team at Canoo noted that the choice to avoid a separate pack structure saved the skateboard platform about 90 pounds of weight and allowed them to hit 195 wh/kg, about 15% higher than what it considered the leading peer.  Tesla structural battery - Battery Day 2020 Tesla structural battery - Battery Day 2020 Tesla structural battery - Battery Day 2020 That’s quite different in the details than the structural battery pack that Tesla outlined at its Battery Day last year. That design will offer a 10% mass reduction, the potential for a 14% range increase, and 370 fewer parts with the cells essentially incorporated as part of a honeycomb against the underside of the vehicle floor, also with a protective pan underneath and lots of structural adhesive. Tesla's proposed full-fledged cell-to-vehicle approach is different, as it skips the modules entirely, but from the sound of it, it seeks some of the same goals, with body and cells part of a structural marriage.  Canoo’s platform, if the battery configuration and the whole approach works, is part of a strategy that includes a skateboard platform with different “top hats” that will allow the company to build activity vehicle, a van, a pickup, a car, and more.   Canoo electric car platform Canoo's is a 400-volt platform, but Savagian explained that the company isn’t giving up any fast-charging rate because of it. He said that’s the right choice for this amount of energy it plans to hold in the car. The size of the battery pack—up to 80 kwh here—is really the limiting factor for charge rate using the highest-current publicly available chargers (around 500A), he explained. “If we had a larger pack and the pack wasn’t the choke point, somewhere around 130, 140 kwh, then it would make sense to go to a higher voltage.” The unique way of containing its battery isn’t the only big technology step Canoo’s vehicles will incorporate. They’re also likely to be the first production vehicles with a full steer-by-wire system, which required the redundancy of dual 12-volt DC-DC converters. Canoo designed those as well as all the key propulsion pieces like inverters and motors in-house. Savagian, widely known in the EV community as an expert regarding inverters and propulsion, said that under his watch as CTO he couldn’t resist some tweaks to the inverter and some of the converters, but he couldn’t take much credit as the previous work was outstanding.   Canoo by-wire systems - June 2021 iinvestor presentation Canoo also configured some of the vehicle’s controllers, with an approach to streamline the chipset for fewer supply issues while also keeping the complexity required for full-vehicle over-the-air updates and future features like a greater level of driver assistance. Canoo says its vehicle is designed for future Level 4 semi-autonomous driving capability, and Savagian said that “in some ways the electrical architecture is autonomous-ready.” While the company originally intended its vehicles to be part of a subscription model, it now sees personal ownership and fleets as 80% of its sales, which amplified the company's attention to reliability and durability. “These vehicles will have a long life, and so our attention to reliability and durability has turned up since my tenure and the beginning of the public company,” Savagian said. Canoo and Tesla certainly aren't the only automakers to discuss structural packs. Volkswagen, at its own ""power day"" earlier this year, outlined that it sees cell-to-pack and cell-to-car as part of its EV future. Although neither Canoo nor Tesla are delivering a structural pack at the moment, both companies could be among the first to embrace this seemingly inevitable evolution within EVs.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results   CANOO INC.    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in
