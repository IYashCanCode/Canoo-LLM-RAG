Identify the industry in which Canoo EV operates,https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/,"Continuing our spotlight on electric vehicle companies you may not have heard about yet is Canoo ($GOEV). The California-based EV startup in beautiful south bay is beginning to ramp up production of multiple electric vehicles. With two EVs unveiled and more on the horizon, Canoo is an electric vehicle company to keep an eye on. Canoo was originally founded in 2017 by two former employees of rival EV automaker, Faraday Future. Ulrich Kranz and Stefan Krause originally called the new startup Evelozcity. Within two years, however, the founders decided to pivot to something a bit more simple. According to Stefan Krause, We picked Canoo because it sounds distinctive, looks cool and creates a feeling of both relaxation and movement. For thousands of years, a canoe has been a simple, sustainable transportation device used all over the world. Later that year, Canoo unveiled its first electric vehicle, an electric passenger van by the same name. The Canoo looks like something out of Westworld.  It immediately set the tone for the brand’s futuristic vision toward its vehicles. Canoo focuses on minimalist design and utilizing space wherever possible, rather than compartmentalizing different parts of the vehicle. In early 2020, the Canoo electric van caught the eye of Hyundai Motor Group. It quickly announced plans to jointly develop an electric vehicle platform for future Hyundai and Kia vehicles. Furthermore, the proprietary skateboard platform will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle components stacked atop it. This is due in part to its “drive by wire” steering, meaning there is no traditional steering column, just connectors. It will allow companies to move the steering wheel wherever desired to better fit the body sitting upon it. Canoo’s funding momentum continued to snowball throughout 2020. By fall, it announced a pending merger with Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV. The merger was completed two months later, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. Canoo is now listed on the NASDAQ as $GOEV. With the support of South Korean automakers and Wall Street, Canoo has spent the last year building toward the delivery of its first EV, The Canoo.  Canoo’s passenger van utilizes maximum cabin space while still sitting atop its modular EV platform. This gives it the footprint of a compact electric vehicle, with the interior of an SUV. The exterior features 22 windows, offering enhanced light and visibility for passengers and drivers. According to its website, the Canoo will only be available in black. Nevertheless, Canoo says endless vehicle wraps will allow owners to customize their EV however they’d like. Moving inward, the Canoo’s interior is designed to feel more like furniture than car seats. With room for seven, the backseat feels like an ultra-modern breakfast nook or a glass limousine.  Up front is minimalist indeed. The information panels exist between the windshields and the glass roof, but are concealed by fabric. Data such as range and speed is illuminated through the fabric when the car is operating. What is most unique about the Canoo van is that it has zero screens. Where current EV automakers are adding larger touchscreens, plus screens for drivers and passengers, Canoo has gone the opposite direction. Instead, the EV offers seamless connectivity to your smartphone using the Canoo app. There is a dock in the center of the dash to hold it in place as well (not visible below). According to the full specs on Canoo’s website, this van will operate with rear-wheel drive on a single, magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor will offer 300 horsepower and 2,803 ft-lbs of peak torque. Its 80 kWh battery pack offers 250 miles of range and can charge to 80% capacity in 28 minutes using DC fast charging. The Canoo will be able to reach a top speed of 125 mph and travel 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds. Consisting of 90% steel, the electric van weighs about 4,450 lbs.  Lastly, these specs are for the RWD single motor, but the Canoo website briefly mentions an AWD powertrain. However, Canoo has not yet offered any further specs. Apart from its overall look, the Canoo is also unique in that it is a subscription-based EV. The Canoo membership will offer a month-to-month and commitment-free alternative to owning or leasing a car. Canoo members will receive 24/7 access to their personal Canoo, as well as additional services like charging, maintenance, and insurance. All these features would be included for a single monthly payment. Canoo has not yet revealed what this subscription model may run you each month. That being said, if the price is right, it could be worth testing out. Currently, the Canoo electric van is scheduled to launch sometime in the second quarter of 2022. For now, prospective customers can join a waitlist to get first dibs when they do deliver.  The most recent electric vehicle unveiled by Canoo is its MPDV, an all-purpose, modular delivery van. The MPDV sits on the same Canoo platform, but with a much different body catered toward deliveries and business owners.  According to Executive Chairman Tony Aquila during the MPDV unveiling, Canoo wanted the EV to appear very smart, but affordable. Its purpose is to serve as a power plant for business owners to pull up, plug-in,  and immediately “do their thing.”  The MPDV was built from the inside out with the users of the EV in mind throughout the development process. As restauranteur Roy Choi phrases it in the video, “it’s like an RV, a van, a delivery truck. Everything all-in-one.” That’s a solid summation from what Canoo has revealed about the MPDV thus far. You can watch the entire unveiling from last December right here: The overall design of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle is both form and function for the working class. Its plug-and-go features offer fully customizable plug-ins to fit your needs. That means no more noisy generators. Customers can have 120- or 240-volt outlets on either side of the exterior, or realistically anywhere else they’d like.  The MPDV’s flat panels throughout the exterior offer owners their own billboard on wheels. They can wrap or design these panels however they’d like, to advertise their business or catch the eye of passersby.  Currently, Canoo has listed two size variations for the MPDV with a third in development. The MPDV1 is 14.4ft x 6.4ft x 6.2ft and offers 230 cubic feet of cargo space, including the front cabin. Depending on the battery capacity, it can haul a payload between 1,540 to 1,980 pounds. The MPDV2 is larger at 17.1ft x 7.2ft x 8.4ft, although it sits on the same platform. This version offers 500 cubic feet of total cargo and can haul between 1,320 and 1,760 pounds. Moving inward, there is a clear focus on sleekness, functionality, and durability. The front cabin does not contain a lot of gadgets. Three phone-like screens offer various pieces of data pertinent to drivers.  According to Tony Aquila, the Canoo lineup was strategically built as a technology platform to not only aid customization, but future innovation. The software within the MPDV is geo located. This can help business owners like food trucks, for instance, keep their customer base informed of its location in real-time. That means no more having to look up hours on social media and hoping the truck is actually there. Additionally, the Canoo platform is operating under level 2.5 autonomy, assisting drivers in safely avoiding danger on roads. Aquila states that as autonomous technologies continue to advance, Canoo will be able to easily incorporate them on its technology platform using over-the-air software updates. Moving toward the rear, the clear focus is function. The unveiling video points out that a grown man can stand in the back without having to duck or crouch. Additionally, the rear is better lit with natural light from the all-glass front. This offers anyone in the back more visibility and that vital vitamin-D. What is most unique and exciting about the MPDVs in particular is the modular capabilities. With the working class in mind, Canoo designed this multi-purpose vehicle to be customized by each and every customer. Whether it’s a live-in camper, a food truck, or an apparel mart on wheels, the top half of MPDV can be reconfigured and designed to offer owners everything they need. We’ve already touched on the variations in size and cargo space between the two MPDVs currently announced by Canoo. Next, let’s dig into the performance and range.  The MPDVs offer front-wheel drive from one permanent magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor offers 200 horsepower and comes with three battery options: 40, 60, or 80 kWh. Starting with the MPDV1, the EPA estimated ranges are as follows: 130 miles on the 40 kWh battery, 190 mi on 60 kWh, and 230 mi on 80 kWh. The MPDV2 can travel 90 miles on a 40 kWh battery, 140 mi on 60 kWh, and 190 mi on the 80 kWh.  Lastly, let’s talk pricing. While the Canoo van will be a monthly subscription, the MPDV will be available for purchase due to its fully custom abilities. The MPDV1 starts at just $33,000 and goes upwards based on custom modifications. It is currently available for pre-order with a $100, refundable deposit. The automaker has previously said a limited rollout of the MPDVs will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch slated for 2023. While Canoo has yet to release its first electric vehicle, the prospect of its unique approach to the market remains exciting. It will be interesting to see how Canoo’s van subscription model will work and if it will find success. If it does, we will keep an eye on the EV market and see if any competitors adopt a similar strategy. The automaker will begin rolling out its first EVs in the US next year. It also plans to expand to the rest of North American and eventually Europe. In addition to its electric van and two versions of the MPDV, Canoo has an even larger MPDV3 being developed.  Lastly, at the end of the MPDV unveiling video, Tony Aquila and Roy Choi ride off, and behind them sit two more prototype EVs covered in black sheets. While it’s impossible to tell exactly what they are, one is shaped like a sedan and the other, a pickup truck. Their black silhouettes are also featured on the Canoo website as “coming soon.” While they are still prototypes, it’s encouraging to see the American automaker with two more potential EV offerings in its pipeline. That’s it for Canoo for now. Keep an eye out for future updates on the company from Electrek.

Identify the industry in which Canoo EV operates,https://evsroad.com/features/canoo-electric-vehicles/,"Canoo is an EV startup based in the US. The company came to light when it struck deals with Walmart, Zeeba, and NASA. Canoo is looking to become the next big thing in the delivery industry of the US by providing cost-effective and sustainable solutions to delivery problems. Let’s see the lineup of Canoo electric vehicles, its history, and where it was founded. Without further ado, let’s begin! Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz founded Canoo Inc., commonly known as Canoo electric vehicles, in 2017. They developed the startup in Torrance, California, as a manufacturer of innovative and futuristic electric vehicles. Canoo has plans to launch electric trucks, multi-purpose delivery vans, tactical vehicles, and minibusses. The company does have a direct-to-consumer vision, but right now, its main focus lies in selling its vehicles to fleet customers such as NASA, Walmart, and Zeeba. Canoo has a very elaborate research and development team based in Auburn Hills, Livonia. This team consists of leaders and innovators from prestigious automotive companies. In short, the history of Canoo electric vehicles isn’t that old. In fact, it won’t be wrong to say that it hasn’t even begun yet. We cannot determine the actual reliability and effectiveness offered by the automaker until its vehicles are made available to the general audience. However, judging by first looks and test drives, Canoo will be a force to reckon with. Canoo was born in the wave of EV startups that had taken the US by storm. The advantage of being an EV startup is that you’re not bound by any previous legacy. There is a chance that you can be a real innovator. That has certainly been the case with Canoo. The company has decided its course much different from all its competitors. Canoo is looking to entirely disrupt the transportation industry. The top competitors of Canoo electric vehicles are Ford, Chevrolet, and Ram. These companies have the largest share of the transportation industry in the US. Their models, such as Chevrolet Express, Ford Transit, Ram Pro Master, and GMC Savana, are extremely popular with delivery companies. However, given that electric is the way to go forward, Ford and Mercedes are going to launch their electric delivery vans soon. Ford E-Transit and Mercedes eSprinter would soon arrive on the market to give tough competition to Canoo MPDV. But one thing is apparent Canoo has the first-mover advantage in this segment, and they have efficiently designed EVs to back their claim. Nonetheless, the actual on-road performance and safety of Canoo vehicles is yet to be tested. Currently, there are four vehicles in the electric car lineup of Canoo. In fact, all these vehicles are in the preorder stage. These vehicles are only made available for test drives. So, we know very little about the capability of these vehicles. Let’s analyze and review everything we know so far about Canoo electric cars. We’ll see their range, battery capacity, and charging infrastructure, among other things. Canoo lifestyle vehicle has become the talk of the town ever since it was revealed. It doesn’t remotely resemble any car or truck available on the market right now. It is a combination of unconventional design ideology and cutting-edge features that exceed industrial expectations.  Canoo has confirmed that for the first year, Canoo lifestyle vehicles will only be sold to fleet customers. Some confirmed orders of the lifestyle vehicle are by Walmart, Zeeba, and NASA. Canoo lifestyle vehicles will be offered in at least four different trim levels. The Delivery, Base, Premium, and Adventure trims will fulfill a specific purpose each. The delivery trim will have room for a single or two persons. The base trim will get five seats, whereas the premium and adventure trims will be seven-seaters. At a DC fast charging station, the Canoo lifestyle vehicle’s 80 kWh battery pack can achieve a charge from 10% to 80% in less than 28 minutes. The powertrain design of the Canoo lifestyle vehicle is very unique. It comes with a rear-mounted 200-pound motor that is capable of churning out 350 hp at 304 lb-ft torque. Now the unique part is that the output of the motor can be programmed between 200 and 350 hp. The lower horsepower setting will enable users to avoid wear and tear and help increase the lifespan of the motor. At the same time, a higher horsepower setting will deliver more power and an exciting drive. But the test drives suggest that Canoo lifestyle vehicles miss the factor of swift acceleration. However, I wouldn’t mind that. Canoo lifestyle vehicle is intended for a very different purpose. Plus, it is offered at an extremely affordable price of $39,950. At this price, it guarantees more than 200 miles of driving range and a cargo volume of over 121 cubic feet. Canoo Pickup Truck is going to be an exciting proposition. It will be a mix of revolutionary EV-startup-like design and practicality. On the one hand, it offers extraordinary features, while on the other hand, it has a strong powertrain and competitive driving range. The front end of the Canoo pickup truck very much resembles the lifestyle vehicle. Canoo pickup truck has the same uplifted look with signature T-style LED headlights and DRLs of Canoo. Canoo Pickup Truck will be offered in two different drivetrain options. A base single-motor rear-wheel drive variant will come with a rear-mounted motor that can generate up to 300 hp at 332 lb-ft of torque. The upper all-wheel drive variant will come with dual motors. The combined output of these motors will be over 600 hp at 550 lb-ft. This puts Canoo Pickup Truck right in the league of A-listers like the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV SUT. These trucks might take the lead on Canoo when it comes to the driving range and conventional design. Canoo pickup truck is laced with a standard lithium-ion battery pack of 80 kWh. The upper variant can go up to 200 miles between charges, whereas the base variant might go a bit longer. However, when it comes to unique features like safe-step, pull-out beds, and dual flip-down tables, Canoo has surely got out attention and an edge over conventional automakers. In case you’re wondering, a safe step is a pull-out platform/storage unit to keep tools and access the bed and roof rack in one single step. The pull-out bed feature extends the regular 4 ft x 6 ft rear bed to 4 ft x 8 ft to enjoy the benefits. In short, the Canoo pickup truck has a lot to offer. If you’re looking for the right mix of power, practicality, and high-end features, Canoo is the way to go. Canoo designed the multi-purpose delivery van with the purpose of offering maximum productivity, efficiency, and cargo volume. It provides substantial cost savings over conventional delivery vehicles. This is quite helpful for small businesses. Canoo MPDV is laced with a permanent magnet motor producing 200 hp at 236 lb-ft of torque. It will also come with a 2.5 autonomous driving capability which is equal to Tesla autopilot. Canoo MPDV is offered in two different versions. The smaller one will be called MPDV1, and the bigger one will be named MPDV2. The company plans to extend the line of MPDVs with a third one. Canoo MPDV1 and MPDV2 will be offered with three different battery pack options. The 40, 60, and 80 kWh. On each of these battery packs, MPDV1 can go up to 130, 190, and 230 miles, whereas MPDV2 can go 90, 140, and 190 miles on 40, 60, and 80 kWh batteries, respectively. Canoo MPDV will also support DC fast charging. It will regain its driving range up to 80% in less than 28 minutes at a rapid charger. So far, no safety tests have been conducted on Canoo vehicles. But since everything in Canoo vehicles is according to industrial standards, we expect these vehicles to be perfectly safe for driving. Canoo Truck will be custom-fitted for the US Army. However, there are no confirmed reports for that yet. The company has unveiled the camouflage-colored Pickup Truck with carbon-Kevlar reinforced body panels, which means that Canoo tactical vehicle will be bullet-proof against light-arm bullets. The cabin can accommodate up to two soldiers, and the military retro-fitted it for use. Canoo light tactical vehicle (LTV) offers multiple benefits, such as stealth and bidirectional charging. It has amazing stealth power due to its electric drivetrain. Canoo LTV is extremely quiet and emits little to no heat signature. There is very little competition in the space of light tactical vehicles. So, there is a bright chance that a deal will take place between the US Army and Canoo. Canoo electric vehicles bring a breath of fresh air to a transportation industry motivated towards a cost-effective and efficient solution. If Canoo is able to deliver on the promises made to its customers, it may emerge as the sole leader in the US delivery industry. What are your thoughts on the Canoo electric vehicles?

Identify the industry in which Canoo EV operates,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)  See you tomorrow.  Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Identify the industry size of Canoo Ev,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoo,"  Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4]  Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7]  In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]    In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11]  In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]  In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]  In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]  In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]  A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]  In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]  In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]  In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]    On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]  It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]  On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]  On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]  On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]  In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.  Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]  On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]  In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]  Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]  In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59] "
Identify the industry size of Canoo Ev,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health.

Identify the industry size of Canoo Ev,https://electrek.co/2023/11/15/canoo-builds-first-ev-okc-begins-generating-revenue-q3/,"EV startup Canoo (GOEV) hit several milestones in the third quarter, including delivering its first EV built at its new Oklahoma facility. “We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase,” Tony Aquila, Canoo CEO, said after delivering Q3 results this week. Although it took “nearly three years to get to this point,” as Aquila explained, Canoo began generating its first revenue during the quarter.  Canoo announced it had delivered its first “Made in Oklahoma” EV to the state Tuesday. The company’s Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDVs) are the first commercial motor vehicles to be built in the state since 2006. The EVs were the first batch of an agreement between Canoo and the state for up to 1,000 vehicles.   The news comes after Canoo said it began generating revenue from its first three vehicles delivered to NASA in July.  Canoo’s journey to get here has been anything but smooth, but the EV maker is finally entering the “revenue-generation phase.” “We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity,” Canoo’s leader explained this week. Despite the progress, “We still have things left to prove.” Canoo is cutting spending with an expected EBITDA loss of $85M to $105M in the second half of 2023. Capital spending is forecasted between $30M to $40M, down from $70M to $100M. Canoo posted revenue of $519,000 on the sale of its first EV, while losses narrowed to $112M in Q3, compared to over $117M last year. The company’s net losses reached $273.6M through September. The EV maker ended the quarter with $8.3M in cash and equivalents, compared to $5M at the end of June.  Canoo also unveiled its “American Bulldog” electric pickup truck last week. The EV pickup is a tribute to the “American spirit and reflects this country’s innovation,” according to Aquila.  With its “Made in America” approach, Canoo expects to benefit from the IRA’s Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit. Canoo customers are eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500.  Although it’s been anything but a smooth ride, Canoo finally generated its first revenue. The company has repeatedly doubted its ability to continue operations over the past few years due to a lack of funding.  The third quarter was a step in the right direction, but with a gloomy economic outlook, the next few months could present even more of a challenge for the young EV startup as it ramps production.

Identify the Identify the industry growth rate of Canoo EV,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high. "
Identify the Identify the industry growth rate of Canoo EV,https://electrek.co/2022/12/22/canoo-goev-now-has-a-million-dollar-reason-to-produce-evs/,"EV startup Canoo (GOEV) has been battling all year to bring its “breakthrough” electric “lifestyle vehicles” to market. The company now has up to a $1 million incentive to manufacture new EVs at its Oklahoma City plant, but there’s a caveat. Founded in 2017, Canoo has raced into the EV market with big expectations. Although, like many EV startups, Canoo quickly began burning cash without a full-scale production vehicle.  After posting a $125 million loss in the first quarter of 2022, Canoo expressed “significant doubt” it would be able to continue operations. However, since then, the EV startup has signed several supply agreements, including an order for up to 10,000 “lifestyle delivery vehicles” from retail giant Walmart. Demand for Canoo’s electric vehicles continued building throughout the year, reporting over $2 billion in orders, with $750 million binding in the third quarter.  Until now, Canoo has been contract-manufacturing its EVs with production capabilities capped at around 10,000 units. In its next phase, Canoo plans to manufacture in-house, with the ability to scale production as needed.  Canoo announced in November it was ready to begin EV production after selecting a 630,000-square-foot move-in-ready plant in Oklahoma City. This week, the city council approved a partnership with Canoo that can earn the EV startup up to $1 million in incentives.  After announcing Oklahoma City as its future EV manufacturing home, Canoo said its new facility would employ more than 500 people and be equipped to achieve a 20,000 unit run rate annually by the end of next year. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt posted on Twitter, saying if Canoo delivers on its job creation promise, the EV startup “can receive up to $ 1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development.” Canoo is planning to manufacture new vehicles in OKC, creating as many as 550 high-paying manufacturing jobs in our city.  If these jobs are created, Canoo will receive up to $1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development. pic.twitter.com/AlNKFz3nsD Mayor Holt adds that although Canoo is planning to produce EVs in Oklahoma City by next year, if it doesn’t come to fruition, nothing will happen, and the fund will remain untouched.  However, if Canoo does pull through like all of us are hoping, the company will receive its incentive, and Oklahoma City will gain “hundreds of high-paying manufacturing jobs in a growing sector of the modern economy.” Despite another over $100 million loss in the third quarter, Canoo says it can raise capital if needed. In addition, Canoo believes its “Made in America” focus has positioned it favorably to earn incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, touting itself as one of the only companies that can take advantage of them immediately.

Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high. "
Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://electrek.co/2022/12/22/canoo-goev-now-has-a-million-dollar-reason-to-produce-evs/,"EV startup Canoo (GOEV) has been battling all year to bring its “breakthrough” electric “lifestyle vehicles” to market. The company now has up to a $1 million incentive to manufacture new EVs at its Oklahoma City plant, but there’s a caveat. Founded in 2017, Canoo has raced into the EV market with big expectations. Although, like many EV startups, Canoo quickly began burning cash without a full-scale production vehicle.  After posting a $125 million loss in the first quarter of 2022, Canoo expressed “significant doubt” it would be able to continue operations. However, since then, the EV startup has signed several supply agreements, including an order for up to 10,000 “lifestyle delivery vehicles” from retail giant Walmart. Demand for Canoo’s electric vehicles continued building throughout the year, reporting over $2 billion in orders, with $750 million binding in the third quarter.  Until now, Canoo has been contract-manufacturing its EVs with production capabilities capped at around 10,000 units. In its next phase, Canoo plans to manufacture in-house, with the ability to scale production as needed.

Identify the industry trends of Canno EV,https://electrek.co/2022/11/11/canoo-goev-begin-commercial-ev-production/,"It’s an exciting time for American EV startup Canoo (GOEV) as the company gears up to begin commercial production. After acquiring a new manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, the company says it’s working on starting production on its own equipment this month.  Canoo has overcome adversity all year. After barely skidding by in the first quarter, taking an over $125 million loss, and expressing significant doubt it will be able to continue, Canoo is on its way to begin commercial production of its flagship electric vehicle, the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV).  Since the first quarter, the EV startup has made substantial progress, signing an agreement with Walmart to supply up to 10,000 electric LDVs, allowing Canoo to live another day.  Although Canoo saw its losses widen in the second quarter, the company continued looking ahead, citing over $1 billion in pipeline sales while reiterating its intent to start commercial production in Q4.  According to Canoo’s latest quarterly earnings filing, the company is on track for the start of production (SOP) on November 17, 2022, after orders doubled to over $2 billion ($750 million binding). The EV startup had several highlights in Q3, including:  Canoo’s announcement to begin EV production comes after securing access to new funding and acquiring two manufacturing facilities to produce its Lifestyle Vehicles, with expected deliveries to begin in 2023. After considering multiple locations, Canoo chose the Oklahoma City location because it was “an existing commercial site with more than 630,000 square feet of move-in ready space and significant room for further expansion.”  The OKC facility will be adapted for Canoo’s needs featuring a full vehicle assembly line with state-of-the-art-robotics, a paint shop, and an unfitting center. Tony Aquila, Canoo’s CEO state: We are working with our third-party manufacturing partners to achieve SOP on our own equipment this month. Following these initial builds, we will aggressively shift all our equipment into our new facility during 1H’23 with production ramp in 2H’23. In addition, Canoo is expanding its production capabilities with a new EV battery module manufacturing facility. Once at full speed, the plant will have around 3200 MWh of battery module capacity. Despite another $117 million loss in Q3, Canoo says it has access to up to $200 million through an ATM offering program, which will allow the company to raise capital if needed.  The EV maker ended the quarter with just $6.8 million in cash, but as the company’s CEO states:  Our Made in America focus has positioned us favorably with the recently announced IRA bill, and we are proud to be one of the only companies, that can take advantage of these incentives immediately. Under the backdrop of a volatile market, we will continue to access the capital markets with our just-in-time, milestone-based approach. Canoo expects operating expenses between $70 million and $90 million in Q4 as the company begins commercial EV production on November 17, 2022. After running up to over $13 per share in November 2021, GOEV stock has come crashing back down to earth, down over 84% this year. Perhaps the start of EV production can charge up Canoo investors once again. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoo,"  Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4]  Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7]  In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]    In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11]  In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]  In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]  In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]  In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]  A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]  In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]  In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]  In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]    On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]  It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]  On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]  On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]  On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]  In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.  Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]  On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]  In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]  Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]  In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59] "
Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://electrek.co/2022/12/22/canoo-goev-now-has-a-million-dollar-reason-to-produce-evs/,"EV startup Canoo (GOEV) has been battling all year to bring its “breakthrough” electric “lifestyle vehicles” to market. The company now has up to a $1 million incentive to manufacture new EVs at its Oklahoma City plant, but there’s a caveat. Founded in 2017, Canoo has raced into the EV market with big expectations. Although, like many EV startups, Canoo quickly began burning cash without a full-scale production vehicle.  After posting a $125 million loss in the first quarter of 2022, Canoo expressed “significant doubt” it would be able to continue operations. However, since then, the EV startup has signed several supply agreements, including an order for up to 10,000 “lifestyle delivery vehicles” from retail giant Walmart. Demand for Canoo’s electric vehicles continued building throughout the year, reporting over $2 billion in orders, with $750 million binding in the third quarter.  Until now, Canoo has been contract-manufacturing its EVs with production capabilities capped at around 10,000 units. In its next phase, Canoo plans to manufacture in-house, with the ability to scale production as needed.  Canoo announced in November it was ready to begin EV production after selecting a 630,000-square-foot move-in-ready plant in Oklahoma City. This week, the city council approved a partnership with Canoo that can earn the EV startup up to $1 million in incentives.  After announcing Oklahoma City as its future EV manufacturing home, Canoo said its new facility would employ more than 500 people and be equipped to achieve a 20,000 unit run rate annually by the end of next year. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt posted on Twitter, saying if Canoo delivers on its job creation promise, the EV startup “can receive up to $ 1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development.” Canoo is planning to manufacture new vehicles in OKC, creating as many as 550 high-paying manufacturing jobs in our city.  If these jobs are created, Canoo will receive up to $1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development. pic.twitter.com/AlNKFz3nsD Mayor Holt adds that although Canoo is planning to produce EVs in Oklahoma City by next year, if it doesn’t come to fruition, nothing will happen, and the fund will remain untouched.  However, if Canoo does pull through like all of us are hoping, the company will receive its incentive, and Oklahoma City will gain “hundreds of high-paying manufacturing jobs in a growing sector of the modern economy.” Despite another over $100 million loss in the third quarter, Canoo says it can raise capital if needed. In addition, Canoo believes its “Made in America” focus has positioned it favorably to earn incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, touting itself as one of the only companies that can take advantage of them immediately.

Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://news.yahoo.com/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-100841631.html,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn't yet generated any revenue. Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews' new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: ""It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. ""Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)"" She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career. Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California's auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Identify the key players in Canoo EV industry,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high. "

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors,https://www.kavout.com/blog/analyst-perspectives-on-canoo-nasdaqgoev-an-investment-evaluation/,"Dec 27, 2023 | Stock Analysis Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), a company within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has been under the scrutiny of analysts and investors alike. In recent times, the stock has experienced significant volatility, prompting a diverse range of opinions regarding its investment potential. This report aims to dissect the prevailing analyst views on Canoo and assess whether it constitutes a good buy, based on the information provided and within the context of the current market environment.    As of the latest available data, Canoo has been the subject of analysis by HC Wainwright and others, with a consensus price target of $2.02, which suggests a substantial upside of 750.91% from its recent trading price. This optimistic forecast is predicated on the assumption of Canoo’s potential to capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and overcome its current challenges. However, the stock’s performance has not been without its setbacks. A report from The Motley Fool highlights that Canoo’s stock price has plummeted by a staggering 99% (Yahoo Finance). This decline raises concerns about the company’s viability and the sustainability of its business model. Despite this, there are signals that Canoo is ramping up production and preparing to make significant deliveries, which could be a turning point for the company’s financial health and stock performance. The EV market has been characterized by heightened enthusiasm, followed by a sobering correction as the initial hype fades. Canoo, like many of its peers, has not been immune to these fluctuations. The company’s stock has suffered as a result, and market sentiment appears to be cautious. Nonetheless, the EV sector remains a high-growth area, and companies that can navigate the production and delivery challenges effectively may be well-positioned to reap long-term rewards. In comparison to its competitors, Canoo’s current market valuation may reflect a disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price. If Canoo can execute its business plan successfully, it could emerge as a competitive player in the EV space, thus justifying the optimistic price targets set by analysts. Canoo’s third-quarter print was promising, indicating that the company may be on the cusp of a turnaround. A positive financial performance and the potential for future growth have led to a ‘Buy’ rating recommendation by some analysts. This perspective is supported by the company’s strategic moves to increase production capacity and readiness to deliver vehicles in large numbers. It is important to note, however, that investing in Canoo carries significant risk. The company’s stock has already experienced a dramatic decline, and while this could present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, it also underscores the potential for further losses if Canoo fails to meet its operational and financial targets. Based on the provided information, it appears that analysts are divided on Canoo’s prospects. While there is a consensus on a high upside potential, the stock’s past performance and the overall volatility of the EV market cannot be ignored. As an analyst, I would opine that Canoo may be considered a speculative buy, with a strong emphasis on the speculative nature of this investment. Investors should approach Canoo with caution and be prepared for the possibility of further volatility. The company’s future success will hinge on its ability to scale production, manage costs, and deliver on its promises to customers and investors. Given these considerations, Canoo could be a good buy for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but it may not be suitable for those seeking stability and predictable returns.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors market share,https://www.kavout.com/blog/analyst-perspectives-on-canoo-nasdaqgoev-an-investment-evaluation/,"Dec 27, 2023 | Stock Analysis Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), a company within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has been under the scrutiny of analysts and investors alike. In recent times, the stock has experienced significant volatility, prompting a diverse range of opinions regarding its investment potential. This report aims to dissect the prevailing analyst views on Canoo and assess whether it constitutes a good buy, based on the information provided and within the context of the current market environment.    As of the latest available data, Canoo has been the subject of analysis by HC Wainwright and others, with a consensus price target of $2.02, which suggests a substantial upside of 750.91% from its recent trading price. This optimistic forecast is predicated on the assumption of Canoo’s potential to capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and overcome its current challenges. However, the stock’s performance has not been without its setbacks. A report from The Motley Fool highlights that Canoo’s stock price has plummeted by a staggering 99% (Yahoo Finance). This decline raises concerns about the company’s viability and the sustainability of its business model. Despite this, there are signals that Canoo is ramping up production and preparing to make significant deliveries, which could be a turning point for the company’s financial health and stock performance. The EV market has been characterized by heightened enthusiasm, followed by a sobering correction as the initial hype fades. Canoo, like many of its peers, has not been immune to these fluctuations. The company’s stock has suffered as a result, and market sentiment appears to be cautious. Nonetheless, the EV sector remains a high-growth area, and companies that can navigate the production and delivery challenges effectively may be well-positioned to reap long-term rewards. In comparison to its competitors, Canoo’s current market valuation may reflect a disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price. If Canoo can execute its business plan successfully, it could emerge as a competitive player in the EV space, thus justifying the optimistic price targets set by analysts. Canoo’s third-quarter print was promising, indicating that the company may be on the cusp of a turnaround. A positive financial performance and the potential for future growth have led to a ‘Buy’ rating recommendation by some analysts. This perspective is supported by the company’s strategic moves to increase production capacity and readiness to deliver vehicles in large numbers. It is important to note, however, that investing in Canoo carries significant risk. The company’s stock has already experienced a dramatic decline, and while this could present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, it also underscores the potential for further losses if Canoo fails to meet its operational and financial targets. Based on the provided information, it appears that analysts are divided on Canoo’s prospects. While there is a consensus on a high upside potential, the stock’s past performance and the overall volatility of the EV market cannot be ignored. As an analyst, I would opine that Canoo may be considered a speculative buy, with a strong emphasis on the speculative nature of this investment. Investors should approach Canoo with caution and be prepared for the possibility of further volatility. The company’s future success will hinge on its ability to scale production, manage costs, and deliver on its promises to customers and investors. Given these considerations, Canoo could be a good buy for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but it may not be suitable for those seeking stability and predictable returns.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors products or services offered,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)  See you tomorrow.  Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors products or services offered,https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/,"Continuing our spotlight on electric vehicle companies you may not have heard about yet is Canoo ($GOEV). The California-based EV startup in beautiful south bay is beginning to ramp up production of multiple electric vehicles. With two EVs unveiled and more on the horizon, Canoo is an electric vehicle company to keep an eye on. Canoo was originally founded in 2017 by two former employees of rival EV automaker, Faraday Future. Ulrich Kranz and Stefan Krause originally called the new startup Evelozcity. Within two years, however, the founders decided to pivot to something a bit more simple. According to Stefan Krause, We picked Canoo because it sounds distinctive, looks cool and creates a feeling of both relaxation and movement. For thousands of years, a canoe has been a simple, sustainable transportation device used all over the world. Later that year, Canoo unveiled its first electric vehicle, an electric passenger van by the same name. The Canoo looks like something out of Westworld.  It immediately set the tone for the brand’s futuristic vision toward its vehicles. Canoo focuses on minimalist design and utilizing space wherever possible, rather than compartmentalizing different parts of the vehicle. In early 2020, the Canoo electric van caught the eye of Hyundai Motor Group. It quickly announced plans to jointly develop an electric vehicle platform for future Hyundai and Kia vehicles. Furthermore, the proprietary skateboard platform will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle components stacked atop it. This is due in part to its “drive by wire” steering, meaning there is no traditional steering column, just connectors. It will allow companies to move the steering wheel wherever desired to better fit the body sitting upon it. Canoo’s funding momentum continued to snowball throughout 2020. By fall, it announced a pending merger with Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV. The merger was completed two months later, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. Canoo is now listed on the NASDAQ as $GOEV. With the support of South Korean automakers and Wall Street, Canoo has spent the last year building toward the delivery of its first EV, The Canoo.  Canoo’s passenger van utilizes maximum cabin space while still sitting atop its modular EV platform. This gives it the footprint of a compact electric vehicle, with the interior of an SUV. The exterior features 22 windows, offering enhanced light and visibility for passengers and drivers. According to its website, the Canoo will only be available in black. Nevertheless, Canoo says endless vehicle wraps will allow owners to customize their EV however they’d like. Moving inward, the Canoo’s interior is designed to feel more like furniture than car seats. With room for seven, the backseat feels like an ultra-modern breakfast nook or a glass limousine.  Up front is minimalist indeed. The information panels exist between the windshields and the glass roof, but are concealed by fabric. Data such as range and speed is illuminated through the fabric when the car is operating. What is most unique about the Canoo van is that it has zero screens. Where current EV automakers are adding larger touchscreens, plus screens for drivers and passengers, Canoo has gone the opposite direction. Instead, the EV offers seamless connectivity to your smartphone using the Canoo app. There is a dock in the center of the dash to hold it in place as well (not visible below). According to the full specs on Canoo’s website, this van will operate with rear-wheel drive on a single, magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor will offer 300 horsepower and 2,803 ft-lbs of peak torque. Its 80 kWh battery pack offers 250 miles of range and can charge to 80% capacity in 28 minutes using DC fast charging. The Canoo will be able to reach a top speed of 125 mph and travel 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds. Consisting of 90% steel, the electric van weighs about 4,450 lbs.  Lastly, these specs are for the RWD single motor, but the Canoo website briefly mentions an AWD powertrain. However, Canoo has not yet offered any further specs. Apart from its overall look, the Canoo is also unique in that it is a subscription-based EV. The Canoo membership will offer a month-to-month and commitment-free alternative to owning or leasing a car. Canoo members will receive 24/7 access to their personal Canoo, as well as additional services like charging, maintenance, and insurance. All these features would be included for a single monthly payment. Canoo has not yet revealed what this subscription model may run you each month. That being said, if the price is right, it could be worth testing out. Currently, the Canoo electric van is scheduled to launch sometime in the second quarter of 2022. For now, prospective customers can join a waitlist to get first dibs when they do deliver.  The most recent electric vehicle unveiled by Canoo is its MPDV, an all-purpose, modular delivery van. The MPDV sits on the same Canoo platform, but with a much different body catered toward deliveries and business owners.  According to Executive Chairman Tony Aquila during the MPDV unveiling, Canoo wanted the EV to appear very smart, but affordable. Its purpose is to serve as a power plant for business owners to pull up, plug-in,  and immediately “do their thing.”  The MPDV was built from the inside out with the users of the EV in mind throughout the development process. As restauranteur Roy Choi phrases it in the video, “it’s like an RV, a van, a delivery truck. Everything all-in-one.” That’s a solid summation from what Canoo has revealed about the MPDV thus far. You can watch the entire unveiling from last December right here: The overall design of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle is both form and function for the working class. Its plug-and-go features offer fully customizable plug-ins to fit your needs. That means no more noisy generators. Customers can have 120- or 240-volt outlets on either side of the exterior, or realistically anywhere else they’d like.  The MPDV’s flat panels throughout the exterior offer owners their own billboard on wheels. They can wrap or design these panels however they’d like, to advertise their business or catch the eye of passersby.  Currently, Canoo has listed two size variations for the MPDV with a third in development. The MPDV1 is 14.4ft x 6.4ft x 6.2ft and offers 230 cubic feet of cargo space, including the front cabin. Depending on the battery capacity, it can haul a payload between 1,540 to 1,980 pounds. The MPDV2 is larger at 17.1ft x 7.2ft x 8.4ft, although it sits on the same platform. This version offers 500 cubic feet of total cargo and can haul between 1,320 and 1,760 pounds. Moving inward, there is a clear focus on sleekness, functionality, and durability. The front cabin does not contain a lot of gadgets. Three phone-like screens offer various pieces of data pertinent to drivers.  According to Tony Aquila, the Canoo lineup was strategically built as a technology platform to not only aid customization, but future innovation. The software within the MPDV is geo located. This can help business owners like food trucks, for instance, keep their customer base informed of its location in real-time. That means no more having to look up hours on social media and hoping the truck is actually there. Additionally, the Canoo platform is operating under level 2.5 autonomy, assisting drivers in safely avoiding danger on roads. Aquila states that as autonomous technologies continue to advance, Canoo will be able to easily incorporate them on its technology platform using over-the-air software updates. Moving toward the rear, the clear focus is function. The unveiling video points out that a grown man can stand in the back without having to duck or crouch. Additionally, the rear is better lit with natural light from the all-glass front. This offers anyone in the back more visibility and that vital vitamin-D. What is most unique and exciting about the MPDVs in particular is the modular capabilities. With the working class in mind, Canoo designed this multi-purpose vehicle to be customized by each and every customer. Whether it’s a live-in camper, a food truck, or an apparel mart on wheels, the top half of MPDV can be reconfigured and designed to offer owners everything they need. We’ve already touched on the variations in size and cargo space between the two MPDVs currently announced by Canoo. Next, let’s dig into the performance and range.  The MPDVs offer front-wheel drive from one permanent magnet synchronous electric motor. The motor offers 200 horsepower and comes with three battery options: 40, 60, or 80 kWh. Starting with the MPDV1, the EPA estimated ranges are as follows: 130 miles on the 40 kWh battery, 190 mi on 60 kWh, and 230 mi on 80 kWh. The MPDV2 can travel 90 miles on a 40 kWh battery, 140 mi on 60 kWh, and 190 mi on the 80 kWh.  Lastly, let’s talk pricing. While the Canoo van will be a monthly subscription, the MPDV will be available for purchase due to its fully custom abilities. The MPDV1 starts at just $33,000 and goes upwards based on custom modifications. It is currently available for pre-order with a $100, refundable deposit. The automaker has previously said a limited rollout of the MPDVs will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch slated for 2023. While Canoo has yet to release its first electric vehicle, the prospect of its unique approach to the market remains exciting. It will be interesting to see how Canoo’s van subscription model will work and if it will find success. If it does, we will keep an eye on the EV market and see if any competitors adopt a similar strategy. The automaker will begin rolling out its first EVs in the US next year. It also plans to expand to the rest of North American and eventually Europe. In addition to its electric van and two versions of the MPDV, Canoo has an even larger MPDV3 being developed.  Lastly, at the end of the MPDV unveiling video, Tony Aquila and Roy Choi ride off, and behind them sit two more prototype EVs covered in black sheets. While it’s impossible to tell exactly what they are, one is shaped like a sedan and the other, a pickup truck. Their black silhouettes are also featured on the Canoo website as “coming soon.” While they are still prototypes, it’s encouraging to see the American automaker with two more potential EV offerings in its pipeline.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors pricing strategy,https://www.kavout.com/blog/analyst-perspectives-on-canoo-nasdaqgoev-an-investment-evaluation/,"Dec 27, 2023 | Stock Analysis Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), a company within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has been under the scrutiny of analysts and investors alike. In recent times, the stock has experienced significant volatility, prompting a diverse range of opinions regarding its investment potential. This report aims to dissect the prevailing analyst views on Canoo and assess whether it constitutes a good buy, based on the information provided and within the context of the current market environment.    As of the latest available data, Canoo has been the subject of analysis by HC Wainwright and others, with a consensus price target of $2.02, which suggests a substantial upside of 750.91% from its recent trading price. This optimistic forecast is predicated on the assumption of Canoo’s potential to capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and overcome its current challenges. However, the stock’s performance has not been without its setbacks. A report from The Motley Fool highlights that Canoo’s stock price has plummeted by a staggering 99% (Yahoo Finance). This decline raises concerns about the company’s viability and the sustainability of its business model. Despite this, there are signals that Canoo is ramping up production and preparing to make significant deliveries, which could be a turning point for the company’s financial health and stock performance. The EV market has been characterized by heightened enthusiasm, followed by a sobering correction as the initial hype fades. Canoo, like many of its peers, has not been immune to these fluctuations. The company’s stock has suffered as a result, and market sentiment appears to be cautious. Nonetheless, the EV sector remains a high-growth area, and companies that can navigate the production and delivery challenges effectively may be well-positioned to reap long-term rewards. In comparison to its competitors, Canoo’s current market valuation may reflect a disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price. If Canoo can execute its business plan successfully, it could emerge as a competitive player in the EV space, thus justifying the optimistic price targets set by analysts. Canoo’s third-quarter print was promising, indicating that the company may be on the cusp of a turnaround. A positive financial performance and the potential for future growth have led to a ‘Buy’ rating recommendation by some analysts. This perspective is supported by the company’s strategic moves to increase production capacity and readiness to deliver vehicles in large numbers. It is important to note, however, that investing in Canoo carries significant risk. The company’s stock has already experienced a dramatic decline, and while this could present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, it also underscores the potential for further losses if Canoo fails to meet its operational and financial targets. Based on the provided information, it appears that analysts are divided on Canoo’s prospects. While there is a consensus on a high upside potential, the stock’s past performance and the overall volatility of the EV market cannot be ignored. As an analyst, I would opine that Canoo may be considered a speculative buy, with a strong emphasis on the speculative nature of this investment. Investors should approach Canoo with caution and be prepared for the possibility of further volatility. The company’s future success will hinge on its ability to scale production, manage costs, and deliver on its promises to customers and investors. Given these considerations, Canoo could be a good buy for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but it may not be suitable for those seeking stability and predictable returns.

Analyse Canoo EV main competitors marketing efforts,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)  See you tomorrow.  Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Learn More Tesla (TSLA -0.11%) defied the odds and upended the auto sector, effectively proving that electric vehicles (EVs) were a viable product. Today, every major car company is working on EVs. But there are also a lot of upstart EV makers that want to follow in Tesla's tire tracks. One of those startups is Canoo (GOEV -1.58%). How likely is this EV maker to succeed? The odds are against it and there are at least three reasons it probably won't.  At this point, Tesla has a whole lineup of autos to sell, from an SUV to a sedan, with a pickup truck in the works. It produced 440,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023, with deliveries of 422,000. While not exactly the largest automaker on the planet, it is clearly well-established.  Image source: Getty Images. Canoo is hoping to produce 20,000 cars in all of 2023, with the goal of doubling that in 2024. But even if it does hit these production targets, it will still be just a fraction of the size of Tesla. Meanwhile, it not only has to compete with Tesla, but also all of the other major automakers that are quickly ramping up their EV capacity. The EV niche is far more crowded than it was when Tesla started out, and that makes standing out today far more difficult. In the first quarter of 2023, Tesla produced revenue of $23.3 billion, up from $18.8 billion in the same quarter of the prior year (auto sales make up around 85% of the top line). Earnings per share came in at $0.73, down from $0.95, at least partly due to swiftly rising costs. But after a long period of red ink as it built its business up, Tesla is a very profitable company today. Canoo's first quarter produced another gusher of red ink. It listed no revenue (zero!) and posted a per-share loss of $0.22. There are some caveats. For example, the California-based company is basically still building its EV business, and you have to spend money to do that before you can start selling products to produce revenue. That is exactly what Tesla did, so the loss isn't exactly unexpected. The loss was also down from a per-share loss of $0.54 in the first quarter of 2022. So in some respects, things are getting better. But the company still has a long way to go before it is sustainably profitable. At this point, Tesla doesn't have nearly as much to prove as it did when it was a start-up like Canoo. In fact, as long as the company doesn't make a huge misstep, it looks like it is here to stay, with ample access to the capital markets to support long-term growth. The same thing can't be said of Canoo. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Canoo had $6.7 million in cash, down from $36.5 million in the year-ago period. That's a very material drop for a company that still has to spend huge sums of cash to build out its business. That fact is highlighted in the company's 10-Q, in which it stated: ""Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding or do not have access to additional capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations."" Canoo could come up with the money it needs, but with the stock down more than 95% from its 2021 highs, selling more stock isn't an investor-friendly option. And with so little cash and the ongoing red ink, debt markets might not be too friendly, either. The company is likely to have to pay dearly for any additional funding at this point, which will limit its earnings and growth potential. If it doesn't find that funding, meanwhile, there's a very real chance that Canoo will go out of business.  Investors could argue that Canoo's vehicles are so wonderful that the company will be successful. Unfortunately, having a superior product doesn't guarantee success. (Betamax lost out to VHS, to cite a famous example.) And even if the EV maker does get its production up and running as it hopes, it still has to compete within a very crowded EV field. Canoo putting a going-concern statement into its Securities and Exchange Commission filing is a very worrying sign that investors should not take likely. At this point, it looks like Canoo will be lucky to survive, let alone take on an EV giant like Tesla. Only the most aggressive investors should even consider the stock, and even they should tread with extreme caution. Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Identify the key trends in Canoo EV market,https://carbuzz.com/news/canoo-could-be-the-key-to-apples-car-making-dreams,"Apple may buy Canoo in a bid to get its own EV off the ground. The success of electric vehicles has really taken off in the last decade, and we have vehicles like the Tesla Model 3 to thank for the wider adoption of EVs. As the world's most valuable automaker, Tesla is making everyone else green with envy, which is why so many are looking to take a slice of the EV pie for themselves. But as many are learning the hard way, it's not nearly as easy as it looks. Apple has been trying and failing to produce its first-ever car, and startup Canoo has also struggled to gain any momentum. But perhaps the key to success is to join forces, and according to a new report from Bloomberg, that may just be in the cards. According to ""a person close to both Apple and Canoo,"" Apple may not be interested in Canoo's technology, but rather its engineers, as Canoo has a number of staff members who have expertise in car interior and exterior design, software, drivetrains, battery technology, and automotive manufacturing, while Apple itself has already poached Canoo's former CEO, Ulrich Kranz, and a number of former Canoo engineers. If this does indeed happen, it appears that Apple would go ahead with its own vision for the Apple Car and would simply use Canoo's human resources to make sure that the car is good enough for mass production. For a tech giant that has no track record in automotive manufacturing, a deal with a relatively experienced automaker could be just the push it needs to finally realize its goals. An acquisition by Apple would certainly benefit the company that created the iPhone, but what benefit would there be for Canoo? After all, its car - the Lifestyle Vehicle - would likely be scrapped. Well, Canoo doesn't seem to have much of a choice: it has been bleeding talent for a long time now, and like Apple, it has failed to make any lasting partnerships with existing automakers stick. With the money of Apple and the engineering know-how of Canoo, a new EV could finally enter the market. Of course, Apple still has a long way to go if it wants to achieve its lofty ambitions of releasing a self-driving car by 2025, but perhaps the input of Canoo will help get the basics of an EV out of the way, allowing Apple to focus on autonomous driving software. We'll bring you more news on this potential deal as we get it."

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

Identify the change in consumer behaviour in Canoo EV market,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.)  See you tomorrow.  Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Learn More Tesla (TSLA -0.11%) defied the odds and upended the auto sector, effectively proving that electric vehicles (EVs) were a viable product. Today, every major car company is working on EVs. But there are also a lot of upstart EV makers that want to follow in Tesla's tire tracks. One of those startups is Canoo (GOEV -1.58%). How likely is this EV maker to succeed? The odds are against it and there are at least three reasons it probably won't.  At this point, Tesla has a whole lineup of autos to sell, from an SUV to a sedan, with a pickup truck in the works. It produced 440,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023, with deliveries of 422,000. While not exactly the largest automaker on the planet, it is clearly well-established.  Image source: Getty Images. Canoo is hoping to produce 20,000 cars in all of 2023, with the goal of doubling that in 2024. But even if it does hit these production targets, it will still be just a fraction of the size of Tesla. Meanwhile, it not only has to compete with Tesla, but also all of the other major automakers that are quickly ramping up their EV capacity. The EV niche is far more crowded than it was when Tesla started out, and that makes standing out today far more difficult. In the first quarter of 2023, Tesla produced revenue of $23.3 billion, up from $18.8 billion in the same quarter of the prior year (auto sales make up around 85% of the top line). Earnings per share came in at $0.73, down from $0.95, at least partly due to swiftly rising costs. But after a long period of red ink as it built its business up, Tesla is a very profitable company today. Canoo's first quarter produced another gusher of red ink. It listed no revenue (zero!) and posted a per-share loss of $0.22. There are some caveats. For example, the California-based company is basically still building its EV business, and you have to spend money to do that before you can start selling products to produce revenue. That is exactly what Tesla did, so the loss isn't exactly unexpected. The loss was also down from a per-share loss of $0.54 in the first quarter of 2022. So in some respects, things are getting better. But the company still has a long way to go before it is sustainably profitable. At this point, Tesla doesn't have nearly as much to prove as it did when it was a start-up like Canoo. In fact, as long as the company doesn't make a huge misstep, it looks like it is here to stay, with ample access to the capital markets to support long-term growth. The same thing can't be said of Canoo. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Canoo had $6.7 million in cash, down from $36.5 million in the year-ago period. That's a very material drop for a company that still has to spend huge sums of cash to build out its business. That fact is highlighted in the company's 10-Q, in which it stated: ""Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding or do not have access to additional capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations."" Canoo could come up with the money it needs, but with the stock down more than 95% from its 2021 highs, selling more stock isn't an investor-friendly option. And with so little cash and the ongoing red ink, debt markets might not be too friendly, either. The company is likely to have to pay dearly for any additional funding at this point, which will limit its earnings and growth potential. If it doesn't find that funding, meanwhile, there's a very real chance that Canoo will go out of business.  Investors could argue that Canoo's vehicles are so wonderful that the company will be successful. Unfortunately, having a superior product doesn't guarantee success. (Betamax lost out to VHS, to cite a famous example.) And even if the EV maker does get its production up and running as it hopes, it still has to compete within a very crowded EV field. Canoo putting a going-concern statement into its Securities and Exchange Commission filing is a very worrying sign that investors should not take likely. At this point, it looks like Canoo will be lucky to survive, let alone take on an EV giant like Tesla. Only the most aggressive investors should even consider the stock, and even they should tread with extreme caution. Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Identify the change in consumer behaviour in Canoo EV market,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/08/10/how-the-increase-in-electric-vehicles-is-affecting-consumer-behavior/,"Joel Li is the Founder and CEO of EV.com. A young entrepreneur building the next generation of Autotrader.   Digital transformation is impacting every industry, and the automotive industry is no exception. With electric and hybrid vehicles on the road increasing significantly over the past 10 years, the automotive industry is experiencing the biggest revolution since the invention of the Model T. There were more than 10 million electric vehicles (EV)s on the road in 2020, and with this shift in car buying trends comes new consumer behavior. The manufacturers and dealerships that understand this shift—and evolve simultaneously with their sales, marketing, and customer experience—will be the ones that find the most success. Those buying EVs aren’t researching miles per gallon and sports packages. Instead, consumers are checking battery range, charging networks, and technology functionality. What actually matters to the consumer has changed, and thus, their buying behaviors. An increased awareness around sustainability, as well as a general distaste in and distrust of the dealership experience, are just two reasons why EVs are shaking up the auto business. Millennials, like myself, simply don’t want to engage in the traditional car-buying experience. We are happy to trade five-hour car dealership experiences for 10 clicks or less to buy a car online. A recent New York Times article shared that millennials were almost twice as likely to shop for and buy a car completely online. They want more transparency into car pricing and an easier, less convoluted buying experience. The in-person sales pitch at the dealership just isn’t working for this generation. The manufacturers and dealerships that embrace this new way of thinking have the best chances of outmaneuvering their competition. Recent studies show that the average EV owner has remained the same over the past 10 years,: 40-55 year old males with an annual household income of more than $100,000. But as sales continue to increase at a fast rate, year over year, it’s likely new trends and demographics will emerge. With EV prices likely to become more affordable in coming years, we’ll probably see more millennials get behind the wheel of a battery-powered car. In recent research, The Fuels Institute found a collection of trends that leads a consumer to ultimately make a purchase: “Affordability, availability, and familiarity appear to be amongst the key factors influencing likelihood of EV purchases.” Overall, McKinsey predicts an industry- and consumer-wide adoption of EVs in the next decade. “In 2030, the share of electrified vehicles could range from 10 percent to 50 percent of new-vehicle sales. Adoption rates will be highest in developed dense cities with strict emission regulations and consumer incentives (tax breaks, special parking and driving privileges, discounted electricity pricing, etc).” The more environmentally focused a city or state, the more likely that area will have higher numbers of EVs. Interestingly, one of the biggest concerns for current and potential EV buyers is “range anxiety.” According to Kalibrate, more than 50% of drivers are worried that an EV will run out of charge while traveling. A lack of charging stations, as well as faulty or broken stations, is also concerning for car buyers contemplating an EV. With most EV drivers recharging daily or once every two days, and usually at home or at a workplace parking lot, the worry is less around regular commutes to work. In fact, according to Fuel Institute, “most EV fleet customers today (2020) operate in a hub-and-spoke network and exclusively recharge their vehicles overnight at their home base.” Drivers are much more concerned about running out of charge on longer trips when planned stops to recharge are necessary. Once the decision to buy an EV is made, one of the first considerations is the network of charging stations. And research shows that charging infrastructure remains a barrier. According to McKinsey, “Sales penetration will be slower in small towns and rural areas with lower levels of charging infrastructure and higher dependency on driving range.” As the automotive industry continues to navigate the digital revolutions, it’s imperative for manufacturers and dealerships to evolve with the changing times. Future success depends on adopting new sales and marketing strategies and understanding the dynamics needs of the customer.

One such company leading the charge is Canoo, an innovative electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer focused on redefining the way we think about mobility. With their unique approach to design, functionality, and subscription-based ownership, Canoo is revolutionizing the EV market and paving the way for a cleaner, greener future. In this blog post, we will explore Canoo's electric vehicles and why they are worth considering for your next eco-friendly ride.  Distinctive Design Canoo's electric vehicles stand out from the crowd with their distinctive design philosophy.

This innovative design approach maximizes interior space, allowing for a more comfortable and functional driving experience. Canoo, offers a diverse range of electric vehicles designed to meet the needs of various customer segments. With a focus on functionality, sustainability, and futuristic design, Canoo has developed four distinct EV offerings that are poised to revolutionize the way we think about transportation. Let's explore Canoo's electric vehicle lineup and their unique features. Lifestyle Vehicle Canoo's flagship model is the Lifestyle Vehicle, a multipurpose electric vehicle designed to provide maximum interior space and versatility. This vehicle combines a minimalist, futuristic exterior design with a spacious and adaptable interior. The Lifestyle Vehicle's modular seating configuration allows for various passenger and cargo arrangements, making it ideal for both personal and commercial use.

Furthermore, the company's emphasis on interior space and modular seating arrangements makes the vehicles highly adaptable, accommodating different passenger and cargo configurations as per the user's requirements.  Subscription-Based Ownership One of the most intriguing aspects of Canoo's approach is its subscription-based ownership model. Instead of the traditional model of purchasing or leasing a vehicle, Canoo offers customers a membership plan that covers all the costs associated with owning an electric vehicle. The subscription includes maintenance, insurance, charging services, and access to the Canoo ecosystem, providing a hassle-free and transparent ownership experience. This unique business model reduces the financial burden of vehicle ownership, making Canoo electric vehicles more accessible to a broader range of customers.  Advanced Technology and Features (work on this section combining everything) Canoo's commitment to innovation extends beyond design and ownership models. Their electric vehicles are equipped with cutting-edge technology and advanced features aimed at enhancing both the driving experience and overall safety. Canoo prioritizes a comprehensive suite of driver-assistance systems, including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring, to ensure a secure and confident ride. Additionally, their intuitive infotainment system, connectivity options, and over-the-air updates keep the vehicles up to date with the latest advancements. Canoo has announced a partnership with Panasonic for the supply of batteries for its upcoming lifestyle vehicle. The vehicle, set to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2022, will be manufactured by VDL Nedcar and cater to the US and EU markets. The decision to select Panasonic as the battery supplier was based on extensive testing and the company's reputation as a global technology leader in cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. Canoo's focus on continuous optimization and creating intellectual property in battery module technology, higher energy density, and flexible thermal management aligns with Panasonic's innovation-driven approach. Panasonic's expertise and track record as a durable electric vehicle battery manufacturer make them an ideal partner for Canoo. Canoo has developed proprietary battery system technologies, integrating battery modules directly into the platform structure rather than using separate enclosures. This design approach provides advantages such as cost optimization, space savings, improved vehicle range, and safety.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

Identify the technological advancement in Canoo EV market,https://electrek.co/2022/12/22/canoo-goev-now-has-a-million-dollar-reason-to-produce-evs/,"EV startup Canoo (GOEV) has been battling all year to bring its “breakthrough” electric “lifestyle vehicles” to market. The company now has up to a $1 million incentive to manufacture new EVs at its Oklahoma City plant, but there’s a caveat. Founded in 2017, Canoo has raced into the EV market with big expectations. Although, like many EV startups, Canoo quickly began burning cash without a full-scale production vehicle.  After posting a $125 million loss in the first quarter of 2022, Canoo expressed “significant doubt” it would be able to continue operations. However, since then, the EV startup has signed several supply agreements, including an order for up to 10,000 “lifestyle delivery vehicles” from retail giant Walmart. Demand for Canoo’s electric vehicles continued building throughout the year, reporting over $2 billion in orders, with $750 million binding in the third quarter.  Until now, Canoo has been contract-manufacturing its EVs with production capabilities capped at around 10,000 units. In its next phase, Canoo plans to manufacture in-house, with the ability to scale production as needed.  Canoo announced in November it was ready to begin EV production after selecting a 630,000-square-foot move-in-ready plant in Oklahoma City. This week, the city council approved a partnership with Canoo that can earn the EV startup up to $1 million in incentives.  After announcing Oklahoma City as its future EV manufacturing home, Canoo said its new facility would employ more than 500 people and be equipped to achieve a 20,000 unit run rate annually by the end of next year. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt posted on Twitter, saying if Canoo delivers on its job creation promise, the EV startup “can receive up to $ 1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development.” Canoo is planning to manufacture new vehicles in OKC, creating as many as 550 high-paying manufacturing jobs in our city.  If these jobs are created, Canoo will receive up to $1 million in incentives from our voter-approved fund that can only be used for economic development. pic.twitter.com/AlNKFz3nsD Mayor Holt adds that although Canoo is planning to produce EVs in Oklahoma City by next year, if it doesn’t come to fruition, nothing will happen, and the fund will remain untouched.  However, if Canoo does pull through like all of us are hoping, the company will receive its incentive, and Oklahoma City will gain “hundreds of high-paying manufacturing jobs in a growing sector of the modern economy.” Despite another over $100 million loss in the third quarter, Canoo says it can raise capital if needed. In addition, Canoo believes its “Made in America” focus has positioned it favorably to earn incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, touting itself as one of the only companies that can take advantage of them immediately.

One such company leading the charge is Canoo, an innovative electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer focused on redefining the way we think about mobility. With their unique approach to design, functionality, and subscription-based ownership, Canoo is revolutionizing the EV market and paving the way for a cleaner, greener future. In this blog post, we will explore Canoo's electric vehicles and why they are worth considering for your next eco-friendly ride.  Distinctive Design Canoo's electric vehicles stand out from the crowd with their distinctive design philosophy. Unlike traditional car manufacturers, Canoo embraces a minimalist and futuristic aesthetic, prioritizing spaciousness and versatility. The company's focus on space utilization is evident in their unique skateboard platform, which houses the battery, motors, and other crucial components beneath the vehicle's flat floor. This innovative design approach maximizes interior space, allowing for a more comfortable and functional driving experience. Canoo, offers a diverse range of electric vehicles designed to meet the needs of various customer segments. With a focus on functionality, sustainability, and futuristic design, Canoo has developed four distinct EV offerings that are poised to revolutionize the way we think about transportation. Let's explore Canoo's electric vehicle lineup and their unique features. Lifestyle Vehicle Canoo's flagship model is the Lifestyle Vehicle, a multipurpose electric vehicle designed to provide maximum interior space and versatility. This vehicle combines a minimalist, futuristic exterior design with a spacious and adaptable interior. The Lifestyle Vehicle's modular seating configuration allows for various passenger and cargo arrangements, making it ideal for both personal and commercial use. With its compact footprint and agile maneuverability, the Lifestyle Vehicle is well-suited for urban environments. Delivery Vehicle Canoo's Delivery Vehicle is a purpose-built electric vehicle designed specifically for last-mile delivery services. It offers ample cargo space and customizable storage solutions to meet the needs of delivery companies. The Delivery Vehicle's low step-in height and wide sliding doors provide easy access to the cargo area, enhancing operational efficiency. With zero-emissions and a focus on functionality, the Delivery Vehicle offers a sustainable and practical solution for the rapidly growing e-commerce and delivery sectors. MPDV The Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle (MPDV) is Canoo's electric van offering, targeting businesses and organizations with diverse transportation needs. The MPDV provides ample cargo space and a flexible interior that can be customized to suit different applications, including passenger transportation, goods delivery, and mobile services. With its adaptable seating configurations, the MPDV can accommodate a range of passenger capacities, making it suitable for shuttle services, ride-sharing, or even recreational purposes. Pickup Truck Canoo's upcoming electric pickup truck is set to join their lineup, catering to the growing demand for sustainable, versatile, and rugged trucks. While specific details about the pickup truck are yet to be released, Canoo's commitment to innovative design, functionality, and sustainability suggests that it will offer unique features and capabilities that set it apart from traditional pickup trucks. Canoo's diverse range of electric vehicles, including the Lifestyle Vehicle, Delivery Vehicle, MPDV, and forthcoming pickup truck, exemplify the company's commitment to redefining sustainable mobility. With their futuristic design, adaptable interiors, advanced technology, and subscription-based ownership model, Canoo's electric vehicles offer innovative solutions for personal, commercial, and last-mile delivery needs. As Canoo continues to push the boundaries of electric vehicle design and functionality, their offerings contribute to a greener future and demonstrate that sustainable transportation can be both practical and exciting. Purpose-Built for Urban Living Canoo electric vehicles are purpose-built for urban environments, addressing the specific needs of city dwellers. With their compact footprint, excellent maneuverability, and nimble handling, Canoo's EVs are perfectly suited for navigating crowded streets and tight parking spaces. Furthermore, the company's emphasis on interior space and modular seating arrangements makes the vehicles highly adaptable, accommodating different passenger and cargo configurations as per the user's requirements.  Subscription-Based Ownership One of the most intriguing aspects of Canoo's approach is its subscription-based ownership model. Instead of the traditional model of purchasing or leasing a vehicle, Canoo offers customers a membership plan that covers all the costs associated with owning an electric vehicle. The subscription includes maintenance, insurance, charging services, and access to the Canoo ecosystem, providing a hassle-free and transparent ownership experience. This unique business model reduces the financial burden of vehicle ownership, making Canoo electric vehicles more accessible to a broader range of customers.  Advanced Technology and Features (work on this section combining everything) Canoo's commitment to innovation extends beyond design and ownership models. Their electric vehicles are equipped with cutting-edge technology and advanced features aimed at enhancing both the driving experience and overall safety. Canoo prioritizes a comprehensive suite of driver-assistance systems, including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring, to ensure a secure and confident ride. Additionally, their intuitive infotainment system, connectivity options, and over-the-air updates keep the vehicles up to date with the latest advancements. Canoo has announced a partnership with Panasonic for the supply of batteries for its upcoming lifestyle vehicle. The vehicle, set to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2022, will be manufactured by VDL Nedcar and cater to the US and EU markets. The decision to select Panasonic as the battery supplier was based on extensive testing and the company's reputation as a global technology leader in cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. Canoo's focus on continuous optimization and creating intellectual property in battery module technology, higher energy density, and flexible thermal management aligns with Panasonic's innovation-driven approach. Panasonic's expertise and track record as a durable electric vehicle battery manufacturer make them an ideal partner for Canoo. Canoo has developed proprietary battery system technologies, integrating battery modules directly into the platform structure rather than using separate enclosures. This design approach provides advantages such as cost optimization, space savings, improved vehicle range, and safety. The platform architecture incorporates various battery-related safety features, including a high-strength steel frame and innovative crash features to protect both passengers and battery integrity. The collaboration between Canoo and Panasonic signifies a shared commitment to advancing electric mobility and reducing global carbon emissions. By leveraging Panasonic's battery expertise, Canoo aims to deliver high-quality, reliable, and efficient electric vehicles that contribute to a sustainable future.  Environmental Sustainability At the heart of Canoo's mission is a dedication to environmental sustainability. By producing all-electric vehicles, Canoo aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Canoo's commitment extends beyond the vehicles themselves, as the company also integrates sustainable practices into their manufacturing processes. They utilize responsibly sourced materials and employ energy-efficient production techniques, minimizing their environmental footprint throughout the entire lifecycle of their vehicles.

Identify the shift in competitive advancement in Canoo EV market,https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

After giving effect to the issuance and sale of the second and third Yorkville convertible debentures for a total of $53.2 million, and proceeds from the August PIPE of $3 million, our cash balance would have been $61.2 million on June 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $70.9 million and $161.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $164.4 million and $289.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.

The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.   Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, August 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results   CANOO INC.    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in

Gather information on Canoo EV revenue,https://electrek.co/2023/11/15/canoo-builds-first-ev-okc-begins-generating-revenue-q3/,"EV startup Canoo (GOEV) hit several milestones in the third quarter, including delivering its first EV built at its new Oklahoma facility. “We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase,” Tony Aquila, Canoo CEO, said after delivering Q3 results this week. Although it took “nearly three years to get to this point,” as Aquila explained, Canoo began generating its first revenue during the quarter.  Canoo announced it had delivered its first “Made in Oklahoma” EV to the state Tuesday. The company’s Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDVs) are the first commercial motor vehicles to be built in the state since 2006. The EVs were the first batch of an agreement between Canoo and the state for up to 1,000 vehicles.   The news comes after Canoo said it began generating revenue from its first three vehicles delivered to NASA in July.  Canoo’s journey to get here has been anything but smooth, but the EV maker is finally entering the “revenue-generation phase.” “We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity,” Canoo’s leader explained this week. Despite the progress, “We still have things left to prove.” Canoo is cutting spending with an expected EBITDA loss of $85M to $105M in the second half of 2023. Capital spending is forecasted between $30M to $40M, down from $70M to $100M. Canoo posted revenue of $519,000 on the sale of its first EV, while losses narrowed to $112M in Q3, compared to over $117M last year. The company’s net losses reached $273.6M through September. The EV maker ended the quarter with $8.3M in cash and equivalents, compared to $5M at the end of June.  Canoo also unveiled its “American Bulldog” electric pickup truck last week. The EV pickup is a tribute to the “American spirit and reflects this country’s innovation,” according to Aquila.  With its “Made in America” approach, Canoo expects to benefit from the IRA’s Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit. Canoo customers are eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500.  Although it’s been anything but a smooth ride, Canoo finally generated its first revenue. The company has repeatedly doubted its ability to continue operations over the past few years due to a lack of funding.  The third quarter was a step in the right direction, but with a gloomy economic outlook, the next few months could present even more of a challenge for the young EV startup as it ramps production.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or Canoo's assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA “EBITDA” is defined as Net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP.

We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
